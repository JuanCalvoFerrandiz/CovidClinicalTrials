0,An Investigation of the Inflammatory Response in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)," Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized illness that can be fatal. The purpose of this study is to better understand SARS by collecting samples of blood and other body fluids of people who have been exposed to SARS or who are suspected to have the illness. Up to 300 volunteers aged 18 years or older will be enrolled in this study. Participants will donate blood samples and, if appropriate, samples of fluid from the lungs, nose, or throat. Researchers will test these samples for proteins that control or mediate inflammatory or immune responses. The patterns of these proteins will reveal how SARS affects the body and the efforts the body makes to fight off the infection. "," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized illness associated with substantial mobidity and mortality. Patients develop fever followed by rapidly progressive and even fatal respiratory disease. SARS is associated with infection with a novel coronavirus. The evaluation of the inflammatory responses evoked by SARS may yield information regarding its pathogenesis and help with patient management. This protocol, then, merely aims to study disease pathogenesis and natural history, by studying samples and data that are collected by outside physicians or physicians at the Clinical Center and sent for evaluation of the inflammatory response.

1,Contamination During Removal of Two Different Personal Protective Systems When Working Under Conditions Requiring Enhanced Respiratory and Contact Precautions," Highly communicable and virulent diseases, the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases, and the prospect of bio-terrorism have become part of the new reality for health care workers. SARS transmission has occurred despite the use of droplet, contact, and airborne precautions. Potential explanations for some of the episodes of “through-precautions” transmission include the possibility of contamination during removal of protective clothing. The recommended protective systems (PPS) for aerosol generating procedures set out by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) differ. The failure of a PPS may be associated with significant consequences in terms of the morbidity and mortality of front-line health care workers. The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists between the rate of self-contamination due to deficiencies in contact precautions for individuals wearing either the CDC or MOHLTC recommended PPS. Study participants will don one of the two recommended PPS, be “contaminated” with an indicator that becomes visible under ultraviolet light, and then assessed for contamination of clothing layers and skin after removal of the PPS. They will then repeat the procedure using the other PPS. "," Background: Highly communicable and virulent diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and “avian influenza”, the ongoing threat of other emerging infectious diseases, and the prospect of bio-terrorism have become part of the new reality for health care workers (1). Recent experience with SARS has demonstrated that front-line health care professionals who perform or assist with aerosol generating procedures are at particularly increased risk of infection. At present, no data exists addressing the question of self-contamination during the removal of personal protective systems used in a health care setting. The latest suggested donning and removal procedures have not been validated with respect to the issue of selfcontamination due to deficiencies in contact precautions. The failure of a personal protective system or the donning and removal procedures for a personal protective system may be associated with significant consequences in terms of the morbidity and mortality of front-line health care workers. It is imperative that the rate of self-contamination for these two personal protective systems be assessed. The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists between the rate of self-contamination due to deficiencies in contact precautions for individuals wearing either Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or the Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR). This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover study. Institutional Ethics Committee approval will be obtained for this study. Fifty participants will be required for the study. Participants will be recruited from the Department of Anesthesiology attending and resident staff, other physician groups requiring PAPR training, and the Department of Respiratory Therapy. Recruitment will occur in conjunction with annual training in the use of the PAPR. Individuals will be informed of the purpose and procedure of the study and written consent will be obtained. Individuals will be excluded if they refuse to provide written consent to participate in the study. Participants will wear operating room scrub attire as their base clothing layer. They will be randomized to don either the PAPR or PPE. They will then repeat the process using the other personal protective system immediately after the study protocol has been completed using the first personal protective system. PPE will consist of an N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, bouffant hair cover, fluid resistant surgical gown, and fitted sterile gloves. Although the CDC has omitted a head covering as part of their PPE, the MOHLTC directives stipulate that a head covering must be worn when performing high-risk procedures in patients that require enhanced respiratory and contact precautions. A head covering (bouffant hair cover) will therefore form part of the PPE used in this study. The CDC recommendations state that goggles can be worn for eye protection. A face shield can be used in addition to the goggles but this is optional. The MOHLTC directives state that goggles and a face shield must be worn during high-risk procedures in patients that require enhanced respiratory and contact precautions. Goggles and a face shield will therefore form part of the PPE for this study. Therefore the donning and removal instructions for the PPE that will be used for this study will differ in sequence from those published by the CDC. The donning and removal procedures that will be used for this study more closely follow the sequence recommended by the MOHLTC and are indeed an enhanced version of those directives. PAPR will consist of a body suit and shoe covers, PAPR hood and power unit, N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, bouffant hair cover, fluid resistant surgical gown, and fitted sterile gloves. The MOHLTC has stipulated the use of donning/removal coaches for the PAPR. Neither the CDC, the MOHLTC, nor our institution have stipulated the use of donning/removal coaches for the PPE. The intent of this study is to examine the protective systems. The donning and removal procedures that form part of the protective systems may either contribute to or minimize self-contamination rates and must be assessed under the actual conditions of use. In order to best simulate the actual conditions that health care workers will be subjected to and to best evaluate donning and removal procedures and practices we have also decided not to employ a donning/removal coach for the PPE. Accordingly, during donning and removal of PPE participants will be given standardized written instructions outlining the donning and removal procedure but will not be coached. Participants will be given standardized written instructions and coached by a respiratory therapist during donning and removal of the PAPR. The standardized written instructions for donning and removal of both the PPE and PAPR are attached in Appendices A and B. All participants will be timed and videotaped during the protective system donning procedure. Timing will commence when the participants are instructed to begin reading 3 their written donning instructions for PPE or when the dressing coach says “begin” for the PAPR. Timing will cease when the participants have completed donning the final item of the protective system being tested. Videotaping will occur in order to record and assist in the detection of any protective system donning procedure violations. A donning procedure violation will be defined as having occurred if the participants perform a donning maneuver out of sequence or touch a piece of protective equipment out of sequence. Participants will be “contaminated” using a solution of fluorescein (1ml of a 25% solution diluted in 100cc sterile water) in a standardized fashion. A Devilbiss atomizer (Model DV-15-RD, Sunrise Medical Products, Carlsbad, California, USA) will be used to apply 5ml of fluorescein solution to the their front face shield and torso. We have chosen these contamination sites in order to simulate areas that would most likely be contaminated by the large respiratory droplets aerosolized by a patient that is either coughing or reacting to intubation attempts or any other high-risk respiratory procedure. The atomizer nozzle will be held at a distance of 30cm from the participants’ face-shield and will be applied from their shoulder level. The spray stream will be directed at the participants’ nose and then aimed inferiorly towards the their umbilicus in an upwards and downwards sweeping motion while keeping the atomizer oriented in the participants’ mid-saggital plane. Application will occur until the atomizer reservoir is empty. During this application the participants’ eyes will be closed. “Invisible” Detection Paste (Sirchie, 100 Hunter Place, Youngsville, NC) will be applied to the palmar aspects of the participants’ hands and anterior and posterior forearm to the elbow. Although the paste is labeled “invisible detection paste” it becomes visible when viewed under ultraviolet (UV) light. 15ml of paste will be used. We have chosen to use detection paste on the forearms and gloves of the study participants as these are the areas most likely to come in contact with any patient requiring enhanced contact and respiratory precautions. Participants will be videotaped, photographed with a digital camera, and assessed with a UV lamp (Burton Medical Products Inc, 21100 Lassen Street, Chatsworth, CA. 91311 USA) following contamination to ensure that standardized contamination of their front face shield, torso, forearm, and palmar aspect of the gloved hands has been achieved. Participants will then follow the standardized written removal procedures for the protective system that they are wearing. They will be timed and videotaped during the protective system removal procedure. Timing will commence when the participants are instructed to begin reading their written removal instructions for PPE or when the dressing coach says “begin” for the PAPR. Timing will be paused during assessments with the UV lamp. Timing will cease when the participants have completed removing the final item of the protective system being tested. Videotaping will occur in order to record and assist in the detection of any protective system removal procedure violations. A removal procedure violation will be defined as having occurred if the participants perform a removal maneuver out of sequence, touch a piece of protective equipment out 4 of sequence, or touch any part of their body other than a piece of protective equipment prior to performing final hand disinfection. Participants will be assessed with the UV lamp at specific intervals during the removal procedure in order to detect any visible contamination. Participants in PPE will be assessed with the UV lamp following removal of the outer PPE protective layer (outer fitted sterile gloves, fluid resistant surgical gown, and faceshield). Final assessment will occur after removal of the inner PPE protective layer (N95 mask, goggles, bouffant hair cover, inner fitted sterile gloves). Participants in PAPR will be assessed using the UV lamp after removal of the outer PAPR protective layer (PAPR hood and power unit, outer fluid resistant surgical gown, outer boot covers, outer fitted sterile gloves). They will then be assessed after removal of the middle PAPR protective layer (body suit, middle sterile fitted gloves, boot covers). Final assessment will occur after removal of the inner PAPR protective layer (N95 mask, goggles, bouffant hair cover, inner sterile fitted gloves). An evaluator blinded to the participants’ protective system will perform final assessment. All areas of the participants’ base clothing layer and any exposed skin and hair will be inspected after removal of the final protective layer. This will include the participants’ face. Contamination episodes will be counted and the contamination area will be calculated in cm2. ",Kingston General Hospital,"Kingston, Canada",Completed,Queen's University
2,"A Phase I Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of a SARS Recombinant DNA Plasmid Vaccine, VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP, in Healthy Adult Volunteers"," This study will test whether an experimental vaccine to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is safe, causes any side effects, and causes an immune response. SARS affects the respiratory system, usually starting with fever and muscle aches. Patients may get a dry cough and have difficulty breathing. Infection may be mild, but it can lead to death. Vaccines contain substances from an infectious agent, such as a virus, that, when injected into a person's body, stimulates production of antibodies that create resistance, or immunity, to that agent. The vaccine in this study contains genetic material (DNA) that codes for a protein found in the virus that causes SARS. Injected into a muscle, it instructs the body to make a small amount of a SARS protein. The vaccine is made from just one small part of the code for one SARS protein, a person cannot get SARS from the vaccine. Normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age who are in general good health may be eligible for this 32-week study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. Participants have nine clinic visits during the study. They receive three vaccine injections, given with a system called the Bioinjector 2000® (Registered Trademark), which delivers the vaccine through the skin without the use of a needle. Following each injection, participants take home a diary card, on which they record their temperature and any vaccine side effects daily for 5 days. Participants must immediately report any symptoms to a study physician, and, if necessary, go to the clinic for an examination. Participants have the following tests and procedures: - Vaccine injections (study day 0, around week 4, and around week 8, with at least 21 days between injections) - Medical history and, if needed, physical examination (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 32) - Check of vital signs and weight (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32) - Lymph node examination (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) - Blood draw (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32) - Pregnancy test for women (day 0 and weeks 4, 8 and 32) - Urine sample (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) "," Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune response of a recombinant DNA vaccine, VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP. The hypothesis is that this regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to the SARS coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) protein. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of the investigational vaccine. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the study vaccine. Product Description: VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP is composed of a single closed, circular DNA plasmid that is based on the S protein of SARS-CoV. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle) using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System. Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 50 years old) will be enrolled. Study Plan: Ten volunteers will be enrolled and receive 3 injections on the schedule shown in the schema. The protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up contacts. Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant. Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen, secondary immunogenicity endpoints are an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for SARS specific T cell responses and an assay for antibody-dependent enhancement of virus uptake. The principal timepoints for ICS are Week 0 (baseline) and Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12. ICS at other study timepoints, as well as other immunogenicity assays through Week 32, will be completed as exploratory evaluations.

3,Clinical Evaluation and Management of Persons With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)," This study will evaluate and treat people with SARS, a new type of pneumonia (lung infection) originating in China. SARS is caused by a new virus that is easily transmitted from person to person. This study will look at the course of the disease, determine how the virus affects the body and how the body fights the infection, and evaluate diagnostic tests to quickly identify the disease. People 18 years of age and older with probable or suspected SARS may be eligible for this study. Close contacts of patients with SARS, patients who recovered from SARS, and NIH health care workers involved in the care of patients will also be enrolled. Patients with SARS who require hospitalization will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center. Because SARS spreads easily, hospitalized patients will be in a room by themselves and will not be allowed any visitors. They will not leave their room except for tests, such as x-rays. All participants will have a full medical examination, including a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. In addition, the participants undergo various tests and procedures as follows: - Probable and suspected SARS patients may be hospitalized or may be seen as outpatients. They are provided the treatment judged best for their disease, usually according to expressed or published recommendations. The best treatment for SARS is not yet known, and there have been no studies evaluating therapies. Outpatients are seen three times a week for 2 weeks, once a week for 4 more weeks, and then at 6 months. Patients have mouth and throat swabs taken three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once a week for 4 more weeks. Blood is drawn three times a week for the first 2 weeks, then once at weeks 3, 4, and 6. If virus is still detectable after 6 weeks, nose washings and throat swabs are repeated until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. In addition, patients provide urine and stool samples, have a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram, and undergo bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage. For the bronchoscopy, a bronchoscope (pencil-thin flexible tube) is passed into the large airways of the lung, allowing the physician to examine the airways. Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed from the lung with salt water. A brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways and pieces of tissue are collected for analysis. - Close contacts of patients are evaluated twice a week for 2 weeks, then once a week for 2 more weeks. Blood is drawn at the first visit and then at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Mouth and throat swabs, nose washings, and sputum collections are done twice a week for 2 weeks, then once a week for 2 more weeks. Urine and stool samples are collected once a week for 4 weeks. If virus from the nose or throat is still detectable after 4 weeks, weekly nose washings and throat swabs continue until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. Blood may also be drawn during the weekly visits. - Recovered SARS patients provide blood, urine, and stool samples and have a mouth and throat swab and nose aspiration to see if the SARS virus is present. For the nasal aspiration, salt water is put in the nose and then suctioned out. Usually, these tests are done only once. If virus is detected, however, the nose washing, throat swabs and blood tests are repeated once a week until no virus is detected for 3 weeks in a row. - Health care workers document their contact with patients, use of isolation procedures and equipment, and any unexpected events that occur during contact. They are evaluated for symptoms of infection and provide a blood sample once a month "," Since mid February 2003, there have been reports of atypical pneumonias originating in China which have subsequently been termed the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS has subsequently spread to multiple countries including the United States, and is accompanied by a higher than anticipated morbidity and mortality. Because of world travel and the apparent easy transmissibility of this disease reported in other nations, the number of patients with SARS may continue to rise. The primary purpose of this protocol is to evaluate and treat persons with SARS. Other goals will be to characterize the clinical course of SARS by also evaluating close contacts of people with SARS, as well as those that have recovered from SARS. Additional goals of the protocol are to elucidate the pathophysiology of SARS, characterize the immune response during SARS, and evaluate diagnostic tests for the rapid identification of SARS in clinical specimens. Further knowledge about SARS may lead to effective forms of therapy and improve mortality from this disease.

4,Collection of Convalescent SARS Plasma by Apheresis," The purpose of this study is to collect plasma by apheresis from patients who have recovered from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This plasma will be processed into a SARS-antibody enriched intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) product. This product will then be available for use in a clinical trial if a SARS epidemic recurs. Potentially eligible participants are people between 18 and 56 years of age who have recovered from SARS. Potential participants will undergo three sequential screenings to determine their eligibility for this study. Eligible participants will then be scheduled for plasmapheresis. After apheresis, additional testing will be performed on a sample of the source plasma. Once the sample has been tested and cleared, the source plasma will be shipped to the United States to the storage facility and finally to the site of manufacturing of the IVIG product. Participants may donate plasma again after 14 days. The study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, participation may help develop a treatment that could be useful to other people who become infected with SARS. "," Beginning in February 2003, there was an outbreak with a novel coronavirus causing an atypical pneumonia, subsequently referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate and has no proven treatment. There is, however, some evidence that treatment with convalescent plasma was beneficial. The primary purpose of this protocol is to collect plasma by apheresis from patients that recovered from SARS, and process this plasma into a high titer anti-SARS intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). This will be a collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Cangene Corporation has been contracted to manufacture the collected plasma in the United States (U.S.) into an IVIG product, which can then be used for pre-clinical efficacy studies under an IND in a clinical trial if SARS recurs. It is intended that the treatment trial would be conducted in Hong Kong and/or the U.S., as well as any other place the disease recurs.

5,"Immune Responses, Transmission and Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Families With SARS Virus Infections"," The purpose of this study is to understand how severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spreads within families, if significant disease resulted, and how the body responds to SARS. The study will also explore the affects of SARS on genetics and the immune system (the body system that fights disease). Up to 1000 people residing in Beijing, China may be involved in this study. Adult survivors of SARS (numbering 200) and their family members including children age 4 and up will be asked to participate in the study. The study will recruit an additional 200 persons, who will be matched with SARs survivors of similar age, gender, health status, and housing/work location, and recruited as comparators. Blood will be taken from all volunteers and tested for the presence of SARS antibodies (proteins made by the body's immune system in response to something that can cause infection). Health and clinic/hospital visit records may be reviewed. "," This study will investigate immune responses, transmission and nucleotide polymorphisms in families with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infections. Study objectives are to: develop an immune response profile to SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) among SARS survivors, ascertain whether there was spread of SARS CoV within the family and whether significant disease resulted, and determine whether 1 or more nucleotide polymorphisms relate to occurrence and severity of SARS CoV disease or immunologic responses. Up to 1,000 persons residing in Beijing, China, will participate in this study and will include the following groups: 200 adult (greater than or equal to18 years of age) subjects, previously experiencing SARS caused by SARS Coronavirus, their household/family members, including children ages 4 and up (male or female), and an additional 200 adults matched for characteristics (age, gender, health status and housing/work location) of the 200 SARS survivors. As much as possible (for DNA tests), these controls will be persons involved in health care with a possible SARS exposure during the epidemic. Blood will be obtained from all subjects and used for SARS CoV antibody assays. Additional studies will be performed with blood specimens from selected subjects. Tests for serum antibodies will be used to identify infected persons in each family. For any who possess specific antibodies, a review of their health and clinic/hospital visit records for the SARS epidemic period will be conducted to identify any illness, its type and severity. A control for interpretation can be illnesses during the study period in uninfected family members. Data will be analyzed by age, gender, and health status of family members, the severity of SARS illness in the index case and the time of return to the home environment. The illness data will be obtained from medical records and not from subject memory. To assess health status, subjects for this study will have a chest x-ray performed and 15 mL of blood obtained for complete blood counts, liver function, to include ALT, and creatinine. For study purposes, 30 to 100 mL of blood will be collected from SARS survivors and from 50 matched controls (age, gender and health status). Illnesses from medical records will be characterized for severity and will include extent of x-ray changes, need for oxygen therapy, medical care in the intensive care unit and extent of leukocyte changes. Microarray chips that contain human genes determining immune responses, production of cytokines and chemokines and a number of other potential responses to illness have been constructed. PureGene kits will be provided for isolation of DNA from blood specimens for testing for polymorphisms. These analyses will be performed on the 200 SARS survivors, the 200 matched controls and on family members. The DNA samples will be shipped to laboratories at Baylor College of Medicine for analysis using the microarray chips.

6,"Phase I, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Dosage Escalation Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of Adjuvanted and Non-Adjuvanted Inactivated SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Vaccine Administered by the Intramuscular Route"," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral illness that affects the respiratory (breathing) system. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and protective (immune) responses to different doses of a SARS vaccine given with or without an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance that may be added to a vaccine to improve the immune response so that less of the vaccine may need to be given. Study participants will include 72 volunteers, ages 18-40, living in the Houston, Texas area. The study will take place at Baylor College of Medicine. Participants will receive 2 injections of vaccine or placebo (substance made to look like the study vaccine but contains no medication) given 1 month apart. Participants will fill out a memory aid (diary) to document daily temperature and illness signs and symptoms for 7-9 days after each injection. During the 9 study visits, several blood samples will be collected. Participants will be in the study for up to 211 days, including screening. "," Severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) is a recently emerged infectious disease that was first recognized in Guangdong Province, China, in November of 2002. Efforts to prevent the spread of this virus stopped the epidemic in July, 2003, but over 8,000 cases had occurred and almost 800 people died. A new virus, a coronavirus, was shown to be the cause and it is believed to be a virus of bats that infected some animals that, in turn, infected people and they gave it to other people. While it is unlikely to again become epidemic, the virus is thought to be a risk for spread to humans if it was released intentionally by a terrorist group. For that reason, the U.S. government is developing vaccines and drugs for use if spread should occur again. This study will test the safety and protective responses to a vaccine against SARS made by a vaccine company for this study. This protocol concerns Phase I clinical testing of an inactivated, purified SARS Coronavirus (CoV) vaccine administered with and without aluminum hydroxide (Alum) adjuvant. The rationale for development of vaccines against SARS-CoV is to provide a means of control in the event a new SARS-CoV epidemic occurs or there is a deliberate release of the virus. Inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine has been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies that block binding of the virus to its receptor, ACE2. The primary objectives of the study are to assess: reactogenicity of escalating doses of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted, inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine among healthy young adult subjects given their first intramuscular (IM) vaccinations with this vaccine, reactogenicity of a repeat IM administration of the same material to healthy young adult subjects one month later, and development and persistence of immune responses to escalating doses of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted, inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine 1 and 5 months after the second (booster"") vaccination. The secondary objective of this study is to assess immune responses to each vaccine 1 month after a single dose. This is a single center, Phase I, out-patient study of the reactogenicity (tolerability and safety) and immunogenicity of escalating doses of an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with and without aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. Each vaccine will be injected as primary and booster vaccinations a month apart in the subject's non-dominant deltoid muscle. Participants will include 72 healthy males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, 18-40 years old from the Houston, Texas area. The study will be conducted at Baylor College of Medicine in 2 sequential stages. This study consists of a preliminary dose-escalation stage (1.a, 1.b, and 1.c) followed by a dose comparison stage (2) as follows: Stage 1a (2.5 mcg), 7 subjects randomized in a 1:3:3 fashion to receive a 2 dose regimen of placebo, vaccine containing 2.5 mcg of antigen and no adjuvant, or 2.5 mcg of antigen and Alum adjuvant, Stage 1b (5.0 mcg), 7 subjects randomized in a 1:3:3 fashion to receive a 2 dose regimen of placebo, vaccine containing 5.0 mcg of antigen and no adjuvant, or 5.0 mcg of antigen and Alum adjuvant, Stage 1c (10.0 mcg), 4 subjects randomized in a 1:3 fashion to receive a 2 dose regimen of placebo or vaccine with 10 mcg of antigen and no adjuvant, Stage 2, 54 subjects (9 per vaccine group) randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to receive vaccines containing, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mcg of antigen without adjuvant, or 2.5 or 5.0 mcg of antigen with Alum, or placebo.

8,," Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new threat to public health since November, 2002. The SARS is highly contagious and is believed to be transmitted by person-to-person through droplet and direct contact. The patients present with fever, chills, cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and diarrhea. The symptoms aggravate in the second week and nearly 40% of the patients develop respiratory failure that requires assisted ventilation. The mortality rate is reported as 6.5%-7%. After several months, the world scientists found the etiology to be a new coronavirus not belonging to the previous coronavirus group I, II and III. The new virus is called SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although the high morbidity and mortality of SARS occurred in adults, there was rare mortality reported in the children. The report from Hong Kong pointed out that the symptoms of SARS in younger children were milder and the clinical course was not as aggressive as in adults. Therefore, the aim of the project is to design the experiment to see the differences of immunological responses to SARS-CoV protein in healthy younger children, teenagers, and adults. The investigators hope that the result could explain the reason for milder disease in younger children and the immunological pathogenesis of SARS.

10,An International Observational Study to Characterize Adults Who Are Hospitalized With Influenza or Other Targeted Respiratory Viruses," Following the sudden and unexpected emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (2009 H1N1) virus, this observational study was initiated to estimate rates of morbidity and mortality and to examine predictors of severity among participants with 2009 H1N1 infection. In 2011, as surveillance indicated that 2009 H1N1 virus was co-circulating with other seasonal influenza A and B viruses worldwide, the protocol was expanded to include other influenza A subtypes and influenza B viruses. The current version of the protocol (released in August 2013) further broadens the scope of this observational study. With the recognition that novel respiratory viruses other than novel influenza A viruses, e.g., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), could become prevalent and of major public health importance, the objectives of this protocol have been expanded. "," The purpose of this observational study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes over a 60-day follow-up period of participants with influenza virus infection (including influenza A subtypes such as H3N2 and 2009 H1N1, or influenza B), or a targeted non-influenza respiratory virus, who are hospitalized with severe illness and/or complications in geographically diverse locations. Specific objectives related to influenza virus infection are to estimate the percentage of participants who go on to develop severe disease or complications that require hospitalization, to obtain information on risk factors for disease severity, and to establish a central repository of specimens for use in virus characterization, including subtyping, antigenic and genetic analyses, identification of signature mutations associated with antiviral drug resistance, mutational evolution, and additional reassortment. Specific objectives related to novel non-influenza respiratory viruses of potential major public health importance are to characterize initial cases and their outcomes in order to develop more specific protocols that could inform the prevention and treatment of these new infections. The information used from this study on participants with influenza and novel respiratory virus infections will be rapidly analyzed and shared broadly in order to guide policymakers and to design future studies. Approximately 500 patients with influenza will be enrolled each year at an estimated 75 sites which are in geographically diverse locations across several continents. Study Plan: - Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled at participating clinical sites. - Patients with a diagnosis of influenza (confirmed or suspected), who are hospitalized with complications or severe disease, will be enrolled. - At enrollment, consent is signed and information (demographics, medical history (including prior influenza and pneumococcal vaccination), medications (including antivirals) and treatments prescribed) will be recorded. A blood sample for serum and plasma will be obtained at enrollment, as well as an upper respiratory tract sample and lower respiratory tract sample, if appropriate. The respiratory specimens will be sent for central reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for influenza. - For participants who are still hospitalized, and not intubated, 5 to 7 days after enrollment an additional upper respiratory sample is obtained. - Status will be re-assessed at approximately 28 days and 60 days after enrollment and another blood sample for serum and plasma will obtained at both time points. - For participants who are mechanically ventilated additional upper and lower respiratory tract specimens will be obtained at specific timepoints. In February 2012, the FLU 004 Genomics protocol v 1.0 was released to the field. In August 2013, v 2.0 of the protocol was released as INSIGHT Genomics. The protocol was expanded beyond the FLU 002 and FLU 003 studies to include all qualifying INSIGHT studies (list of qualifying studies is posted on the INSIGHT website, www.insight-trials.org). The purpose of this substudy is to obtain a whole blood sample from which DNA will be extracted to study polymorphisms in immune response genes and other genetic variants that may be associated with an increased risk of severe influenza. Participating FLU 003 Plus sites are given the option to also participate in INSIGHT Genomics which requires a separate protocol registration. Participants, once consented to FLU 003 Plus, will be offered the option to also consent to INSIGHT Genomics which includes a single whole blood sample collection. Participation in FLU 003 Plus will not be compromised if a participant opts not to participate in INSIGHT Genomics.

11,Testing of Respiratory Specimens for the Validation of the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel Test and the Artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR Test," The study will be conducted using nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected prospectively from individuals suspected of having the signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection caused by a respiratory virus. A series of standard viral culture tests validated for routine use in the clinical laboratory, and/or a series of PCR-based Laboratory Developed Tests (PCR-LDT) validated by a central reference laboratory will be used to verify the performance of the investigational artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test and the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test. From each specimen five (5) aliquots will be prepared: (a) one aliquot will be tested in real-time using the assigned viral culture reference methods, (b) one aliquot will be used to extract nucleic acid in real-time for investigational testing, (c) one aliquot of the specimen will be stored at --70C for subsequent shipment to the reference laboratory for PCR-LDT testing, (d) one aliquot will be archived at -70C for subsequent follow-up by the reference laboratory (e.g., bi-directional sequencing of positive specimens), and (e) any remaining specimen will be stored for the Fresh vs. Frozen Study. The extracted nucleic acid generated from the second aliquot (i.e., b"" above) will be split and subjected to testing by both the artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test and the ResPlex II Advanced Panel test. """," Each year the morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory tract infections fluctuates seasonally. This rise and fall is associated with the changing prevalence of respiratory viruses in the population. Myriad respiratory viruses are responsible for these infections. For example, Influenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza Virus, Human Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus have all been identified as causing such acute infections. Numerous pathogenic subtypes have been identified within most of these viral groups. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was eventually identified as a Coronavirus, the mortality of SARS among the elderly can be as high as 50%. More recently, Human Bocavirus (HBoV) has also been identified as causing acute respiratory tract infections. In 2005 the HBoV was identified by molecular testing and was found to be the only virus identified in a subpopulation of patients suffering from respiratory tract infections. Apart from supportive measure (e.g., bed rest, hydration, etc.), there are no effective treatments for many of these viral infections, however, antiviral agents (e.g., the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir) can be used to alleviate the severity of flu-like symptoms. Identification of a respiratory virus as the causative agent is important because it eliminates the need for treatment with antibiotics, physicians typically wait 7-10 days for symptoms to alleviate before prescribing antibiotics due to risks associated with exacerbating bacterial antibiotic resistance. Each year the virus population fluctuates, and with it the antigenic presentation of the dominant strains that circulate through the population. Epidemics arise when larger and larger portions of the population do not have innate or acquired immunological resistance to such strain(s) in a given season. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a separate website dedicated to tracking outbreaks of influenza, especially avian influenza (https://www.who.int/fluvirus_tracker). These zoonotic transmissions that further adapt to enable human-to-human transmission are of the greatest concern because it is predicted that virtually all humans will be immunologically naïve. Zoonotic transmissions in the human population are monitored in the hope that a pandemic similar to the Spanish Flu of 1918 can be avoided, it is estimated that well over 25 million people died from the Spanish Flu. The United States government also maintains a separate website with resources regarding the flu and pandemic related information (http://www.pandemicflu.gov/). On June 11, 2009 the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to 6 in response to the global appearance of a new strain of swine Influenza A (subtype H1N1). The rapidity with which the H1N1 virus has spread exemplifies the notion that quickly and accurately identifying a viral pathogen associated with an outbreak is critical to global public health. In addition to the threat of an influenza outbreak, the expansion in the number of viruses that cause acute respiratory tract infections compounds the difficulty in correctly and rapidly identifying the primary pathogen, each new virus or subtype increases the complexity of testing. Molecular diagnostic assays are ideally suited to address this complexity. Assays based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can incorporate multiple primers and probes (e.g., multiplexed) in a single reaction to deal with this complexity.4 Such assays are extremely sensitive, have a high degree of specificity, and can be performed very quickly. The artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test is a real-time PCR assay for the detection and identification of Influenza A and B, while the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test is a nucleic acid amplification-based assay for the detection and identification of a broad range of some of the most common respiratory viruses associated with acute respiratory tract infections. In the present study respiratory specimens will be prospectively collected and tested using the artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test and the QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test.

15,Anti-MERS-COV Convalescent Plasma Therapy," Since the first report of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus (MERS- CoV) in September 2012, more than 800 cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) with substantial mortality. "," World knowledge about this virus is accumulating but data about the clinical presentations of infected patients and common treatments, including ribavirin, interferon and methylprednisolone, lack evidence. Although drugs with anti- coronavirus (CoV) activities have been identified, as yet no anti- MERs- CoV drug has been approved and a vaccine has yet to be developed. Previous reports on other viral infections including SARS have suggested that convalescent plasma or serum is effective where no other treatment is available or in an emergency. A recently completed systematic review and meta-analysis by the University of Nottingham - World Health Organization Collaborating Center indicates that convalescent plasma therapy may be the most promising near-term therapy patients with for MERS- CoV infection. In this study, investigators will study the pharmacokinetics of immunoglobulin in response to convalescent plasma administration in order to inform a much larger study which will investigate the efficacy of convalescent plasma.

The investigators collected the base-line (pre-exposure) serum of healthcare-personnel in a few centers, and will collect the post-exposure serum from about 25-30 centers in which confirmed MERS patients had been treated. The investigators will deduct the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG among the healthy healthcare-personnel, and calculate the sero-conversion rate if possible. The investigators will subdivided the seroprevalence according to the degree of exposure and preparedness of personal protective equipment. "," We aim to deduct the seroprevalence of healthcare-personnel (HCP) who had participated in treatment of confirmed patients of Middle-East respiratory syndrome.

17,"A Phase 1, Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single Ascending Dose Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics Study of SAB-301 in Healthy Adults"," Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a newly discovered contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory virus. People often get MERS through close contact with an infected person. Scientists are worried that MERS may spread and cause more infections. There are no vaccines or treatments for MERS right now. Researchers think a new therapy called SAB-301 may be able to help. Antibodies are proteins the body makes to attack viruses. SAB-301 is made of antibodies made in cows to fight MERS. The antibodies are collected from plasma, the liquid part of cow blood. Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAB-301 in healthy adults. Eligibility: Healthy people ages 18 60 who: Do not have chronic medical problems Do not take any medications (exceptions are acetaminophen, ibuprofen, vitamins, seasonal allergy meds and oral contraception) Do not have allergies to beef products Agree to use two forms of contraception while on study (both men and women) Design: Participants will be screened with: Medical history Physical examination Blood and urine tests Participants will have a return visit. They will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will be randomly assigned to receive either SAB-301 or a placebo which is given by infusion through an arm vein over 1 3 hours. They will be monitored at the clinic for 6 hours after the infusion. They will have additional blood draws. Participants will have 2-hour visits 1, 3, 7, 21, 42, and 90 days after the infusion. At each visit they will be evaluated and have blood and urine tests. "," The administration of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin is often used for treatment of emerging infectious diseases. However, production of large quantities of anti-pathogen human plasma and/or immunoglobulin with high affinity and avidity antibodies currently requires donations by convalescent humans, a process that can limit availability for a number of reasons. One novel alternative source is transchromosomic (Tc) cattle that produce fully human polyclonal IgG (hIgG) de novo and mount a robust antibody immune response after vaccination. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SAB-301, a fully human polyclonal anti-MERS IgG collected from transchromosomic cattle. Beginning with a low single-dose, subjects are randomized to receive either SAB-301 or a normal saline control, and evaluated on Study Days 1, 3, 7, 21, 42, and 90.

18,Incidence of Respiratory Illness in Outpatient Healthcare Workers Who Wear Respirators or Medical Masks While Caring for Patients," Despite widespread use of respiratory protective equipment in the U.S. healthcare workplace, there is very little clinical evidence that respirators prevent healthcare personnel (HCP) from airborne infectious diseases. Scientific investigation of this issue has been quite complicated, primarily because the use of respirators has become the standard of care"" for protection against airborne diseases in some instances, even without sufficient evidence to support their use. The key question remains: How well do respirators prevent airborne infectious diseases? The answer to this important question has important medical, public health, political and economic implications. """," Prevention strategies are key in limiting the transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza. Among non-pharmacologic interventions, there is intense interest in the use of facial protective equipment (FPE) - medical masks (MM) or N95 respirators (N95) - as a key component of personal protective equipment (PPE) when faced with respiratory illness including influenza. However, their relative protective effect is unknown, especially in the outpatient setting (OPD). To plan for future epidemics and best manage limited supplies of FPE, evidence is needed to guide planning activities and policy makers. This project aims to answer a key question: How do N95s protect healthcare workers (HCWs) in the OPD against influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory illness (ARI) and other causes of respiratory illnesses including respiratory viral illness (RV), as compared to MMs? The study outcomes are to: - determine the most effective FPE equipment to use to prevent disease transmission in the OPD during an influenza outbreak, epidemic or pandemic event. - the incidence of organism-specific rates of ARI in the OPD during the RV season. - the incidence rate of organism-specific respiratory viral infections in the OPD. Clinics (or their functional partitions) will be randomized into either the N95 or MM arm using a stratified randomization scheme to ensure comparability between the two arms. All participants, regardless of study arm, will be fit-tested for an N95. The study will require a 16-18 week period that will be initiated when viral surveillance data indicates that influenza season has begun. Participants will be recruited through informational meetings with clinic staff. Participants will have blood drawn before week 1 and after the end of the active portion of the study to assess seroconversion over the study period to capture the incidence of non-symptomatic influenza. All participants will fill out a pre-study survey and post on knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding influenza, influenza vaccinations, and appropriate PPE. During the first week, participants will fill out a form with basic demographic and workplace information. Participants will be asked to 1. wear participant's appropriate FPE when in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed influenza or RV for the next 12-16 weeks, 2. fill out a daily form assessing exposure to ILI and FPE use, and weekly forms assessing RV symptoms and medication use. The investigators will collect nasal and throat (pharyngeal) swabs twice during the study for all participants, and when participants report having an ILI or ARI. Study staff will make unannounced visits to the clinics to observe FPE and hand hygiene compliance rates. Participants will be compensated for participation (as detailed below). To be included the clinical site leadership has agreed to have one of more participants in the trial. To be included the subject(s): (1) meets the definition of healthcare personnel"" (2) is able to read and sign informed consent (3) agrees to all requirements of the protocol, including fit testing and diary keeping (4) is 18 years old or greater (6) passes fit testing for one of the study supplied N95 and agrees to use that model for the entire 16 week period of the study. Subjects are excluded if: (1) subject self-identified as having severe heart, lung, neurological or other systemic disease that one or more Investigator believes could preclude safe participation (2) are known to not tolerate wearing FPE for any period (3) facial hair, or other issue such as facial adornments, preclude respirator Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-compliant fit testing or proper mask fit during the study period (4) subjects are advised by Occupational Health (or other qualified clinician) to not wear the same or similar respirator or medical mask models used in this study (5) in the opinion of the Investigator, may not be able to reasonably participate in the trial for any reason (6) Self-identified as in, or will be in the third trimester of pregnancy, during the study period. Participants will be compensated for participation. Due to space limitations details are not presented here but are available from the overall study PI's. During the study period, study staff will be making unannounced visits to the clinics to measure hand hygiene and FPE compliance. The information collected will not be shared with the supervisors or administration of the clinics. Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT) Analysis Plan 1. Analysis timeline and procedures A pre-specified analysis plan for the primary manuscript of ResPECT was initially approved by all study principal and study-site lead investigators on April 2016 and updated in May 2017 to reflect the addition of the Laboratory Detected Respiratory Infection (LDRI) outcome to the analysis. At the time of this revision (a) all data collection is complete, (b) all laboratory specimen samples have been tested for the primary and secondary outcomes, and (c) the database housing all of the ResPECT data contained no information about which clinics were assigned to which arm of the study. Once the analysis plan is updated and changes submitted to the site IRB's, the data coordinating center will release labels that identify separate arms of the study to the ResPECT statisticians who will use those codes to implement the analysis as described in this document. 2. General outline of analysis framework The ResPECT study was a cluster-randomized trial that used constrained randomization (i.e. matching) to ensure balance across arms. The analysis described in this document is an unmatched analysis, i.e. the analysis does not explicitly account for the matching. This has been described as an appropriate approach to analyzing data arising from a matched design. The final analysis of ResPECT outcome data will consist of intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses (PP) for each of the five study outcomes defined below. For each analysis, the investigators will fit and report results from both adjusted and unadjusted models. Unadjusted models will be analyzed at the cluster-level, and will only include a main effect estimate for the mask and the cluster-level random effects to account for repeated measures of related clusters across multiple seasons. Adjusted models will be analyzed at the individual-level and will include individual-level covariates and random effects to account for repeated measures of the same individual across seasons. 2.a Intention-to-treat analysis The ITT analysis will include all of the ResPECT participants who were randomized— i.e., those assigned a mask based on participant's clinic affiliation. Participant's data will be included according to participant's treatment assignment, regardless of participant's adherence to protocol, subsequent withdrawal, failure to provide requested data/samples, or loss to follow-up. This analysis is intended to capture a more realistic outcome of intervention by acknowledging that noncompliance and protocol deviations are an unavoidable part of clinical practice. In this study, any person who was eligible according to the baseline survey will be included in the ITT analysis. The outcomes for many participants will be missing, particularly those who withdrew during the course of the study. This missingness could conceivably be (a) related to outcome/illness status if individuals were more likely to quit the study because the individuals became sick, or (b) related to the assigned intervention if those assigned one mask over another were more likely to withdraw from study participation. The investigators will assess possible relationships between self-reported reasons for withdrawal and measured variables. Approaches for imputing missing data are addressed below. 2.b Per-protocol analysis Any participant who completed at least eight weeks of study participation will be included in the per protocol analysis. This strategy will include some participants who only had one blood draw or who are missing reliable serological data due to timing of or lack of information on vaccination (see Participant flow for ResPECT study analysis approaches showing ITT and per protocol cohorts and Decision Algorithm for serological influenza outcome adjudication below). These inclusion/exclusion criteria were decided on by the study PIs. The reasons for missing participant blood samples include loss to follow-up with or without formal withdrawal/deactivation, sample loss due to handling/labeling error, or insufficient sample volume. Since the serologic definition of influenza seroconversion is a 4-fold increase in titer, unpaired serology cannot be assigned an influenza seroconversion status and must be imputed. Missing serologic data will not exclude the patient from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-laboratory assessment. Hence, if an individual is missing a second blood draw but had lab-confirmed influenza by PCR, then this individual will be considered to have had a lab-confirmed influenza outcome. This may create non-random missingness, but it was decided by PIs that since this would not impact many study participants the risk of bias to the overall study was very low. 2.c Handling of missing data via imputation methods There will be substantial missing data in the outcome (lab-confirmed influenza) and other covariates. The missing data will be imputed using standard multiple imputation techniques, creating imputed datasets with no missing values for each analysis. Each of these datasets will be analyzed using the regression models described below. The results from all of the analyses will be pooled using standard multiple imputation techniques for combining estimates across imputed datasets. 2. d Process for determining participant membership in ITT and per protocol cohorts Participants signed informed consent. Those who failed to meet inclusion criteria or did not complete screening were excluded. Those who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to a mask group and formulate the ITT cohort. The 'per protocol' cohort will not include those who withdrew before participating (i.e., those who do not fill out any daily or weekly surveys), or discontinued the intervention (withdraw with less than 8 weeks of participation). The 'per protocol' cohort will include those who completed at least 8 weeks of study. The investigators define, for each participant, the amount of time that participants participated as the difference between the clinic activation date and latest of either the automatically-generated time-stamp of the last completed daily or weekly survey or the collection date of the last swab, with a maximum of 12 weeks. Those who participated for at least 8 weeks (56 days) according to this calculation will be included in the 'per protocol' cohort. For analyses using person time, the investigators will use the latest of the following, the last survey completed date or collection date from a swab collection. Decision Algorithm for serological influenza outcome adjudication: This decision algorithm documents the process for which ResPECT participants will be determined to have had laboratory-confirmed influenza based on serological testing only. The possible outcomes are: laboratory confirmed influenza confirmed by serology (LCI-S) and no laboratory confirmed influenza event confirmed by serology (no LCI-S). In some cases, outcomes (either LCI-S or no LCI-S) will be imputed. The algorithm to classify and/or impute these outcomes is as follows: Step 1: Determine Study Completion Determine if participants have completed the study (and thus in the 'per protocol' cohort) or if participants have not and thus are in the ITT cohort Step 2: Determine serological influenza outcome for those in the 'per protocol' cohort 2a. For those individuals in the 'per protocol' cohort who have two serological samples, collected at the beginning and end of the season according to protocol, and who experience a four-fold rise in influenza hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HAI) titer to exactly 0 strains, classify the serological influenza outcome as no LCI-S. 2b. For those individuals in the 'per protocol' cohort who have two serological samples, collected at the beginning and end of the season according to protocol, and who experience a four-fold rise in influenza HAI antibody titer to one or more strains, classify the serological influenza outcome as LCI-S. 2c. For those individuals in the 'per protocol' cohort who do not have two serological samples, collected at the beginning and end of the season according to protocol or who are missing vaccination info or were vaccinated during the study, impute the serological influenza outcome as LCI-S. Missing LCI-S status will be imputed using standard multiple imputation techniques, creating multiple imputed datasets with no missing values for each analysis. Step 3: Impute the LCI-S outcome for the ITT cohort Some members of the ITT cohort did not complete all weeks of the study and may be missing a serological outcome for the same reasons mentioned above. For these individuals, the serological influenza outcome must be imputed. Missing LCI-S status will be imputed using standard multiple imputation techniques, creating multiple imputed datasets with no missing values for each analysis. 2.d Model and variable selection This data is from a cluster-randomized clinical trial. The investigators anticipate that the constrained randomization will ensure balance across important covariates. The clinics were pair-matched by the following characteristics: Study site Clinic size Clinic type (ED/Urgent care, Primary Care, Outpatient, Enhanced) Enhanced PPE (whether HCWs wore enhanced PPE during patient procedures, e.g. in dental and dialysis clinics) Patient population (Pediatric, Adult, or mixed) Because these variables were matched on, the investigators will not adjust for any of them in the multivariable regression models. However, cluster-level random intercepts as well as additional participant-level covariates will be added to the model to adjust for possible residual confounding that is not controlled for by the cluster-randomized design. These covariates will be individual-level variables including: Age, Gender, Race (White, Black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan Native) and ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino) Number of household members under 5 (this has been noted as a strong risk factor for influenza), Categorical occupation risk level (low, medium, or high), Binary season-specific flu vaccination status (was or was not vaccinated), Proportion of daily surveys where an individual reported exposure to someone with respiratory symptoms, and Individual-level (self-reported) measures of mask and hand hygiene compliance. The investigators will attempt to include all of the above-listed variables in the analysis. No variable selection will be performed to optimize the goodness of fit of the model. No Type I error rate adjustments will be made. Variables will be left out only if the variable contribute to instability in model estimation: e.g. collinearity (identified by variance inflation factors) or insufficient data to impute covariate status. In the model design stage, the investigators identified a full set of covariates that would satisfy the sample size recommendation that the investigators have no more than m/15 parameters in the model, where m = min(n1, n2) and n1 and n2 are the numbers in each of the response variable categories. Based on preliminary estimates of the total number of influenza outcomes expected, the investigators aimed to keep the number of estimated parameters below 25. The following variables were considered but not included in the analysis for the final model. Justification is provided. Follow-up variables such as contact with household members with flu: noisy, lacking flu confirmation, and too reliant on self-reporting biases. Cumulative study-based vaccination status (i.e. ever vaccinated, never vaccinated): would be collinear with seasonal vaccine status. Absence from work: not directly related to outcome, chose to include average number of hours worked instead. Dummy variables of clinic types: while these encode important questions, they aren't the main purpose of the central study, and were characteristics that were matched on. Size of household: for parsimony, the investigators will include number of household members under 5 instead. Clinic size: was used in matching for randomization. Comorbid conditions: hard to justify including some and not others, of secondary relevance to the main outcome. Average number of hours worked per week defined each season for each individual: there was a minimum number of hours worked defined in inclusion criteria, so this range will not be substantial. Smoking status: secondary relevance to main outcome. 2.e Pre-specified exploratory analyses In addition to the pre-specified analyses of primary and secondary outcomes, the investigators will run several pre-specified exploratory analyses to assess the impact of vaccine coverage and protocol compliance with the study outcomes. Using the models described in Sections 3 and 4 below, the investigators will consider adding additional covariates to the models from the primary and secondary analyses. Specifically, the investigators will examine the impact of covariates specific to a particular cluster-season including: Vaccine coverage among participants in the cluster Hand-hygiene compliance rate Measure of how often any HCW in the clinic wore any mask, MM or N95 Proportion of clinic HCW enrolled in study and size of clinic Additionally, the investigators will assess interaction terms considering the following variables: Interaction of cluster-level mask compliance with mask group Interaction of individual-level vaccination status with mask group Finally, the investigators will investigate combinations of cluster-level, seasonal, individual-level and cluster-seasonal random effects to capture different possible correlation structures of the data. The magnitude of each variance component will dictate whether the variance components are included in the final model. 3. Analysis plan for primary outcome: laboratory-confirmed influenza 3.a Outcome definitions A dichotomous variable will indicate whether or not a participant had an episode of laboratory-confirmed influenza during a single influenza season. As specified in the protocol, individuals who have a PCR-confirmed influenza infection collected within seven days of symptom onset or who have a 4-fold rise in antibody titer will be considered as a positive case, As described above, the investigators will implement a per-protocol analysis and an ITT analysis. 3.b Planned descriptive analysis The descriptive analysis will focus on aggregated participant numbers across the groups specified in ""respect outcome tables.xlsx"". The tables are as follows: 1) demographics, comprised of a breakout across treatment arms of characteristics including age, race, gender, occupation, clinic characteristics, vaccination status, and comorbid conditions, 2) Adjudication, where tallies of ResPECT participants are broken down into categories depending on participant's eligibility for the ITT and PP analyses and influenza adjudication outcome by year, 3) Nasopharyngeal swab lab results, where participants are broken out by year and mask type across the possible influenza and non-influenza viruses tested during the study, and 4) Summary results of lab-confirmed influenza, lab-confirmed non-influenza, ARI, LCRI, LDRI and ILI across intervention arms only. 3.c Planned Primary Analysis The investigators will use an individual-level logistic regression model to estimate the difference in influenza infection between the N95 and medical mask groups. Let Y_ijs be an indicator of whether subject i in cluster j developed laboratory-confirmed influenza in season s, and MASK_js is an indicator of which mask the clinic was assigned to in season s (0 if medical mask and 1 if N95). Then the investigators will fit a version of this model logit[Pr(Y_{ijs}=1|MASK_{js})]=Beta_{0}+Beta_{1}*MASK_{js}+SUM_{k}(Theta_{k}*X_{k,ijs}+alpha_ {j} + alpha_{i} where the alpha_{j} are the cluster-level random intercepts, the alpha_{i} are the individual-level random intercepts (both assumed to be normally distributed), and the X_{k} refer to the individual-level covariates listed in Section 2.d. Unadjusted analyses will drop individual-level covariates and random intercepts, but will retain the cluster-level random effects. For each fitted model, the estimated odds ratio comparing the odds of infection for those HCPs wearing N95s compared to those HCPs wearing medical masks (i.e. exp(Beta_{1}) will be reported, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The ITT and PP will use the same model equation (shown above) but will use different subsets of participants from the full cohort as described above. 3.d Planned Sensitivity Analysis To account for the unavoidable additional uncertainty regarding the missing data from the primary outcome, the investigators will conduct a sensitivity analysis that randomly assigns binary outcomes to participants who did not complete the study. Specifically, the investigators will create a two-dimensional grid on which the investigators vary the influenza attack rates in participants who dropped out of the study for both the medical mask (MM) and N95 arm, separately. The investigators will fix the MM dropout attack rate between half and twice the observed MM attack rate, based on complete data. The investigators will fix the N95 dropout attack rate between half and twice the observed N95 attack rate, based on complete data. By varying these two parameters across the grid, and for each combination, calculating the adjusted odds ratio (averaged across n=50 imputed datasets for each point on the grid), the investigators will observe the sensitivity of the results to values of the missing data. Additionally, the investigators will compare rates reporting of symptomatic events in the two study arms. If the investigators detect a statistically significant difference in symptomatic reporting between arms, the investigators will include a covariate adjustment of person time in each model to account for the amount of person time under observation. 4. Analysis plan for secondary outcomes 4.a Definitions of secondary outcomes: Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI): This outcome is the incidence of ARI as a clinical syndrome. ARI will be defined as the occurrence of signs or symptoms of respiratory infection, as defined by Table 2 in the published protocol with or without laboratory confirmation. Influenza-Like Illness (ILI): This outcome is the incidence of ILI as a clinical syndrome. ILI will be defined as temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater plus cough and/or a sore throat, with or without laboratory confirmation. Laboratory Confirmed Respiratory Illness (LCRI): This outcome is defined as a laboratory confirmed respiratory illness from any of the pathogens listed in Table 4 in the protocol. Laboratory confirmed respiratory illness is ARI combined with laboratory confirmation by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infection with any of the pathogens listed in Table 4 in an upper respiratory specimen swab after symptoms were reported and within seven days of the original symptomatic report (PP definition of LCRI and confirmed April, 2016). Events with multiple viruses detected will count as a single event of LCRI. If a swab that tested positive but was not associated with a symptomatic event (i.e. was not collected between symptom onset and seven days after symptom onset) then the incident does not count as a LCRI event. If an individual seroconverts to influenza, had symptoms at some time during the study, and does not have a PCR-confirmed pathogen event already, then the investigators will assign them a single LCRI event. Laboratory-detected respiratory infection (LDRI): For a participant with or without symptoms, a laboratory-detected infection is defined as: 1) detection of a respiratory pathogen by PCR or other laboratory methods or 2) serological evidence of infection (e.g., seroconversion) with a respiratory pathogen during the study surveillance period(s). In a case where two or more pathogens are identified in the same specimen, each pathogen will be considered to represent a separate infection (e.g., 2 pathogens as 2 events, 3 pathogens as 3 events) for that study participant for that time-point. Sequential detection of the same pathogens by PCR or other laboratory method in swabs collected at least 21 days apart will be considered separate infections. For all of these endpoints, an individual may experience any or all of the outcomes more than once during the course of the 12-week study. Within the same study identification (ID), participants must report being symptom-free for at least seven days prior to the beginning of the second event, except for LDRI which has the longer 21-day window separating events. As in the primary endpoint section, the secondary outcomes analysis will also include a per-protocol and an ITT analysis. A general description of these approaches is provided above, with specific modifications discussed below. 4.b Planned secondary outcome ITT analysis As in the primary outcome ITT, this analysis will include all of the randomized ResPECT participants regardless of withdrawal status, participation, or protocol adherence. Secondary outcomes will be characterized using a per-week rate of infection so that all participants may be included. The investigators will use a covariate-adjusted individual-level log-linear Poisson regression analysis with person time as an offset term as well as cluster-level and individual-level random intercepts. For the ITT analysis, the amount of person time will be fixed at 12 weeks for each participant, regardless of how much time participant participated in the study. The investigators will include the same covariates as described in the primary outcome analysis section above in the Poisson regression model for the ITT and per-protocol analyses. Unadjusted models will include only the cluster-level random intercepts. For each fitted model, the estimated incidence rate ratio between the N95 and medical mask arm will be estimated and reported, with a 95% CI. 4.c Secondary outcome per-protocol analysis Per-protocol analyses will use the same Poisson regression methods described for the secondary outcome ITT analyses. Additionally, the per-protocol analyses will include ResPECT study participants who completed at least 8 weeks (starting at the time of site activation) of the 12-week trial. All randomized participants will be included unless participant withdrew, were administratively withdrawn, or deactivated before participating for at least 8 weeks. Calculation of person-weeks for each participant will proceed as follows: for individuals who withdrew, completion date will be determined by the earliest withdrawal or deactivation date, in the event that these dates conflict, the earlier date will be used. For all other participants, active participation time will be calculated as the time between clinic activation and the latest of either the automatically-generated timestamp of the last completed daily or weekly survey or the collection date of the last swab, up to 12 weeks. 4.d Missing covariate data for secondary outcomes The analysis approaches for the secondary outcomes will encounter instances of missing data, either in or failure to report relevant information on self-reported forms. Areas in which these issues may require special handling are 1) missing swab collection dates, 2) missing swab results, and 3) incomplete symptomatic event reporting. Missing swab collection dates are relevant for matching swab results to symptomatic event reports. Where this data is missing (often in the case of swabs collected using take-home kits, where participants self-collected the nasopharyngeal (NP) samples), the investigators will attempt to match swab results to symptomatic reporting events using the swab number or process of elimination (ie, only one event was reported and only 1 symptomatic swab was provided). Missing swab results may occur due to practical considerations (running out of PCR plates), participant noncompliance, or handling errors. These results are truly missing, cannot be recovered, and therefore must be discarded. There are also a few instances (<30 out of >11,000, or <0.27%) in which results cannot be reliably matched to the correct individual due to barcode transcription errors. These will be discarded if there is any doubt about the correct assignment barcode. Since these errors did not arise in a systematic way and comprise a very small portion of the overall available and reliable swab samples, this decision should not affect the analysis outcome. A few instances also exist in which participants provided a symptomatic swab but failed to complete a symptomatic event form. Since the participant provided no details to accompany the biological specimen, the investigators will not include these data in the analysis of ILI events (which require specific symptom reports). However, positive symptomatic swab data lacking specific symptom data will be included in the ARI and LCRI. """,Houston VA Medical Center,"Houston, United States",Completed,Johns Hopkins University
19,Implementation of Lung Protective Ventilation in Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure," This is a quality improvement study with the purpose of observing and measuring the effects of implementation of a proven standardized lung protective ventilation protocol in the new electronic medical record system iCentra across all Intermountain Healthcare hospitals. Approximately 14,000 records will be accessed for this study from a database of mechanically ventilated patients established for quality improvement purposes. The investigators hypothesize that implementation of a standardized computerized lung protective ventilation protocol across all Intermountain Healthcare hospitals will be feasible, will decrease initial tidal volumes to the target 6 ml/kg PBW, and will improve outcomes. The objectives of this study are to: - Determine if the implementation of lung protective ventilation (with a 6 ml/kg PBW tidal volume ventilation protocol on initiation of mechanical ventilation) improves outcomes in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation - Determine if the implementation of lung protective ventilation (with a 6 ml/kg PBW tidal volume ventilation protocol on initiation of mechanical ventilation) improves outcomes in the sub-group of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - Measure compliance with the implementation of a computerized lung protective ventilation protocol at 12 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals "," Study Design: This is an observational quality improvement study comparing outcomes before, and after, implementation of a proven lung protective ventilation protocol in an electronic medical record system, iCentra, that will be implemented in phases across Intermountain Healthcare hospitals. A phased implementation with a two-month washout period will be used to evaluate the primary outcome of interest, ventilator free days (VFDs) to 28 days. Secondary outcomes will include: use of the protocol by clinicians, compliance with protocol instructions, hospital discharge disposition, hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality, time to first ICU activity, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, heath care utilization, quality of life, and costs of care. As the iCentra electronic medical record is implemented at Intermountain Healthcare hospitals, clinicians will have the opportunity to use the computerized lung protective ventilation protocol, or to order mechanical ventilation settings independently. This is an observational study designed to measure how often the computerized lung protective ventilation protocol will be ordered, compliance with the instructions of the protocol, and clinical outcomes among patients who are managed with the protocol. Physicians may choose to use the protocol on intubated patients requiring mechanical ventilation or they may choose to order other specific mechanical ventilator settings.

22,"The 15-year Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on Organ Functions, Exercise Capacity, and Quality of Life in Survivors."," SARS-CoV has caused severe epidemic respiratory disease in human populations. By July 2003, a total of 8,096 probable cases of SARS had been reported including 774 deaths in 27 countries, around one-third of which were health care workers (HCWs). Previous studies have been reported about long-term impacts of SARS infection, including lung function deficiency, steroid-induced osteonecrosis, reduced exercise capacity, and impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HCWs, especially nurses, have been reported to experience greater psychological distress, particularly increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS). But the very complex impacts of this fatal infection on HCWs have not been fully elucidated.

23,Streptokinase Versus Unfractionated Heparin Nebulization in Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): A Partially Randomized Controlled Trial," Background: Intra-alveolar clotting and alveolar collapse in ARDS is due to alveolar capillaries epithelial and leakage. Subsequently, collapse induces hypoxemia that is resistant to recruitment (RM). Heparin and Streptokinase may prevent or dissolve intra-alveolar fibrin clot respectively helping alveolar re-expansion. We examined and compared the effect of nebulizing Heparin versus Streptokinase on reversing this pathology. Methods: Sixty severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2<100) patients and failure of RM, prone position (PP) and neuromuscular block (NMB) were partially randomised into Group (I): (n=20) received nebulized Heparin 10000 IU/4h. Group (II): (n=20) received nebulized Streptokinase 250,000 IU/4h. Group (III): (n=20) received conservative management. Randomization to either Heparin or Streptokinase groups was applied to patients whom guardian accepted participation, while those who declined participation were followed-up as a control. The primary outcome was the change in PaO2/FiO2, the secondary outcomes included the change in compliance, plateau pressure, ventilation-off days, coagulation and ICU mortality. "," Methods: The current study was carried out in the Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary University Hospital following approval by the local Research and Ethics Committee and after obtaining of a written informed consent from the first of kin of the recruited patients. The guardians of the patients with severe ARDS fulfilling the inclusion criteria of our study were offered to participate in the trial. Randomization to either Heparin or Streptokinase groups was applied to patients whom first of kin agreed to participate in the trial, while patients whom first of kin declined to participate were followed up as a control group. Written informed consent to participate in the trial and to undergo randomization to either Heparin or Streptokinase group was signed by the guardians who approved their patients to participate. Written informed consent to use patients data was signed by the guardians who declined their patients to participate. Adult patients aged 21-60 years and admitted to our ICU with the diagnosis of ARDS according to Berlin definition (12) were examined and followed up for the presence of the following inclusion criteria, - Severe ARDS with PO2/FiO2 ratio<100. - Failure of Recruitment Maneuver (RM), (13) Prone Position (PP) (14) or Neuro-Muscular Block (NMB) (15) to improve hypoxemia. - No contraindications to thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy (e.g. Coagulopathy, Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, Previous administration of streptokinase, Known or suspected allergy to heparin or streptokinase, History of intracranial hemorrhage in the past 12 months, Patients with an epidural catheter in place or likely to be placed within the next 48 h.). Only patients who have all the three criteria were included in the trial following consenting the first of kin. Sixty severe ARDS patients with failure of RM, PP and NMB and the absence of a contraindication to thrombolytic or anticoagulant therapy were recruited. Forty patients whom guardian agreed to participate actively in the study were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: Group (I): 20 patients received inhaled Unfractionated Heparin at a dose of 10000 IU/4h by nebulizer, with the total daily dose of nebulized Unfractionated Heparin 60,000 IU Group (II): 20 patients received inhaled Streptokinase at a dose of 250,000 IU/4h by nebulizer, with the total daily dose of nebulized Streptokinase 1,500,000 IU. A random set of numbers were generated by the computer (www.randomizer.org), and each number was sealed in an opaque envelope, and the envelopes were kept in the ICU. One envelope was randomly selected after a patient was selected for recruitment and his/her first of kin consented. The key for assigning numbers to either group was stored on encrypted USB device with one of the investigators. One of the investigators was responsible for preparing the medication nebulizer while the nurse and the ICU physician attending the case and recording the data were blinded to the patients group. Twenty patients whom guardian declined to participate actively in the study but accepted to participate passively by consenting for using their data, were assigned as Group III, or the control group. All patients received the routine intensive care protocol for cases of ARDS including the specific ventilatory protocol (16) with monitoring and recording of the following parameters: PaO2 [arterial partial pressure of oxygen], FiO2 [Fraction of inspired oxygen], PaO2/FiO2 ratio, Lung compliance [ml/cmH2o], Peak airway pressure [cmH2o], Coagulation profile [platelets count, prothrombin concentration, INR (International Normalized Ratio), bleeding time] and any side effects or complications as bleeding, coagulopathy, HIT (Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia) and allergic reactions. Start and termination of therapy: Heparin nebulizer or Streptokinase nebulizer (according to the study group) will continue till the occurrence of one or more of the following: (1) Improvement of the hypoxemia as determined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio >300. (2) Improvement of the pulmonary compliance of the patient measured by ventilator defined as dynamic compliance > 50 ml/cmH2O. (3) The occurrence of complications as bleeding or coagulopathy. (4) Failure of the therapy to produce improvement in hypoxemia or compliance after 72 hours of initiation of therapy. Considering that in case of improvement in either parameter, oxygenation or pulmonary compliance will mandate continuation of therapy for a maximum of 4 days. Nebulization Heparin or Streptokinase were nebulized by Aeroneb Pro@ Lab mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Limited, Galway, Ireland) which is incorporated within GE Healthcare's Engström Carestation ventilator (General Electric Company, Finland). Aeroneb nebulizer is a palladium vibrating mesh nebulizer. The central aperture plate of the nebulizer is 5mm in diameter and is perforated with 1000 precision formed holes, that vibrate at 128,000 times per second, to produce the particles with size 1-5 micron in diameter with average MMAD (Mean Mass Aerodynamic Diameter) is 2.1 microns. The nebulized medication (either streptokinase 250,000 IU or heparin 10.000 IU) was prepared in 3 ml volume of distilled water and nebulized for a period of 15 minutes every 4 hours. As per the manufacturer, 0.3 ml of residual volume remains in the nebulizer after each nebulization. Nebulized medications were delivered to the circuit at the junction between the Y-piece and the ETT (Figure 1) to allow the minimal distance between the nebulization delivery port and the ETT. A filter in the expiratory limb (between the ventilator end of the breathing circuit and the ventilator machine) prevented contamination of the circuit. Humidification was supplied by Fisher& Paykel MR 370 humidifier, with the humidifier was stopped and disconnected from the breathing circuit 10 minutes before nebulization and restored 10 minutes after the end of nebulization. During the nebulization, to ensure adequate drug delivery, the ventilatory settings were changed to volume controlled ventilation with TV 500 ml, RR 14/min., I: E ratio of 1:1.5, inspiratory pause 75% of the inspiratory time, PEEP 10 cmH2O with FIO2 of 1. In case of high peak airway pressure ≥40 cmH2O, the tidal volume was decreased gradually to keep peak airway pressure <40 cmH2O. The initial ventilatory settings were restored 10 minutes after the end of nebulization. The day of start of nebulization is considered day 0 and readings for day 1 was recorded 24 hours after the start of nebulizers. Ventilation: A pressure-regulated volume-controlled mode (auto flow) of mechanical ventilation was used. The target tidal volume was set at a range from 4 to 8 ml /kg we started by 6 ml/kg then increased or decreased according to Plateau pressure and CO2 level. Plateau pressure limit up to 30 CmH2o, and CO2 was maintained within normal limit (35 - 45 mmHg), PEEP was maintained 10 mmHg, the Respiratory rate was adjusted according to CO2 level and I: E ratio was maintained at 1: 2. this was routine practice at the time of the study. The trial of weaning used a spontaneous pressure support mode. The level of pressure support was adjusted to maintain the target tidal volume. Extubation was considered if patients meet the criteria of weaning such as being hemodynamically stable and cooperative in addition to minimal ventilator parameter (SpO2> 95% on a pressure support mode < 10 cm H2O, PEEP < 5 cm H2O and FiO2 < 50%). Outcomes The primary outcome was the mean daily ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 (PaO2/FiO2). The Secondary outcomes included, static lung compliance, plateau pressure, change in PaCO2, ventilator-off days in surviving patients at ICU discharge, ICU mortality at discharge from ICU and coagulation profile and occurrence of any bleeding complications. Sample size estimation and Statistical analysis: Sample size calculated after obtaining preliminary data from 5 patients in control group that revealed mean (SD) of PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day 8 was 82(13). Assuming 30% difference between groups and by using G power software (version 3.1.3, Düsseldorf, Germany) with power 95% and alpha error and with doubling SD, total sample size was 57 patients rolled up to 60 for possible dropout. The data were examined for normality of distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (P <0.05). Continuous variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean ± SD (range) and were compared for significant differences between groups by using independent t-test. Paired t-test was used for intragroup comparisons between day-1 and day-8 for each group. Comparison of the means of normally distributed data was done using Two-way analysis (Two Factors (Group and Time)) of variance (between within mixed design) to test Group, Time and Group*Time interaction. The categorical variables were presented in numbers and were compared for significance by using chi squared (χ2) test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. For all comparisons, a P value < 0.05 will be considered significant. IBM SPSS Advanced Statistics Version 22.0 was used for Data Analysis (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). ",,,Completed,Beni-Suef University

26,Lessening Organ Dysfunction With VITamin C (LOVIT), LOVIT is a multicentre concealed-allocation parallel-group blinded randomized controlled trial to ascertain the effect of high-dose intravenous vitamin C compared to placebo on mortality or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days in septic intensive care unit patients. Patients with COVID-19 are considered eligible to this study. ," Background. The burden of sepsis is increasing worldwide. It is the cause of 8 million global deaths each year. Currently, treatment options are limited to antimicrobials and supportive care such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the absence of effective therapies specifically targeting the dysregulated immune response, prolonged use of these life-sustaining therapies can be debilitating. A growing body of evidence suggesting that vitamin C, an inexpensive and readily available intervention, is potentially lifesaving in sepsis. Intravenous vitamin C may be the first therapy to mitigate the dysregulated cascade of events that leads to sepsis. If proven effective, vitamin C could be used worldwide and drastically change outcomes in high- and low-income settings alike. Objectives. To determine whether intravenous vitamin C, compared to placebo, reduces mortality and morbidity in sepsis (induced by bacterial and viral pathogens (as COVID-19)), and compare clinical and biochemical measures of organ dysfunction, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 months. To ascertain the volume of distribution, clearance, and plasma concentration over a course of 96 hours of intravenous vitamin C 50 mg/kg of weight every 6 hours or matching placebo (pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy). Methods. Patients will be randomly assigned to vitamin C (intravenous, 50 mg/kg every 6h) or placebo (0.9% NaCl or dextrose 5% in water) for 96 hours. Study personnel at the clinical sites will document the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction at day 28. Daily assessments will occur for organ function, on days 1, 3, 7 for inflammation, infection, and endothelial injury biomarkers, at baseline for vitamin C level, and at 6 months for mortality and HRQoL. The LOVIT Trial will be conducted in adult general Canadian and international intensive care units. For the PK substudy: Blood samples will be drawn around the 6th dose (second dose on day 2) at time 0 and then after administration at times 1h, 2h, 4h and 6h (the 6h level will be immediately prior to the next dose). The PK substudy will be conducted with 100 participants in 3 of the 25 participating centers. Relevance. In the context of increasing off-label use of vitamin C for sepsis and ongoing trials of vitamin C bundled with other pharmacological interventions, the LOVIT Trial will constitute a rigorous assessment of the effect of vitamin C monotherapy on patient-important outcomes.

31,Safety and Efficiency of Mesenchymal Stem Cell in Treating Pneumonia Patients Infected With 2019 Novel Coronavirus," The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. There is no confirmed antivirus therapy for people infected 2019-nCoV, most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) therapy for pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. "," 2019-nCoV infection has become an urgent public health event in China. As of 24:00 on January 26, 2020, there are 2744 confirmed cases and 461 severe cases in China, the number is still increasing. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. In the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients .

New infectious agents, such as the SARS, MERS and other novel coronavirus, novel influenza viruses, viruses causing viral haemorrhagic fever (e.g. Ebola), and viruses that affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as TBEV & Nipah require investigation to understand pathogen biology and pathogenesis in the host. Even for known infections, resistance to antimicrobial therapies is widespread, and treatments to control potentially deleterious host responses are lacking. In order to develop a mechanistic understanding of disease processes, such that risk factors for severe illness can be identified and treatments can be developed, it is necessary to understand pathogen characteristics associated with virulence, the replication dynamics and in-host evolution of the pathogen, the dynamics of the host response, the pharmacology of antimicrobial or host-directed therapies, the transmission dynamics, and factors underlying individual susceptibility. The work proposed here may require sampling that will not immediately benefit the participants.

44,Vitamin C Infusion for the Treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV Infected Pneumonia: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial," 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia, namely severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) has caused global concern and emergency. There is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment for SARI. Vitamin C is significant to human body and plays a role in reducing inflammatory response and preventing common cold. In addtion, a few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. We hypothize that Vitamin C infusion can help improve the prognosis of patients with SARI. Therefore, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for the clinical management of SARI through randomized controlled trials during the current epidemic of SARI. "," At the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China. At 21:00 on January 7, 2020, a new coronavirus was detected in the laboratory, and the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids was completed at 20:00 on January 10. Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Up to February 4, 2020, over 20000 cases have been diagnosed in China, 406 of which have died, and 154 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world. Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases. SARI has caused global concern and emergency. Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different.

46,"The Efficacy and Safety of Thalidomide in the Adjuvant Treatment of Moderate New Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia: a Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo, Parallel Controlled Clinical Study"," In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 can be an alternative target for current treatment. Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-angiogenesis, and immune regulation effects. This study is the first Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo, Parallel Controlled Clinical Study at home and abroad to use immunomodulators to treat patients with COVID-19 infection. "," The new coronavirus (COVID-19) [1] belongs to the new beta coronavirus. Current research shows that it has 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45), but its genetic characteristics are similar to SARSr-CoV. There is a clear difference from MERSr-COV. Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a new type of coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, as of 12:00 on February 12, 2020, a total of 44726 confirmed cases nationwide (Hubei Province) 33,366 cases, accounting for 74.6%), with 1,114 deaths (1068 cases in Hubei Province), and a mortality rate of 2.49% (3.20% in Hubei Province). In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 can be an alternative target for current treatment. Thalidomide has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-angiogenesis, and immune regulation effects. In the early clinical practice of treating severe A H1N1, it was clinically concerned, and combined with hormones and conventional treatment, and achieved good results. Although the death rate of COVID-19 infected persons is not high, their rapid infectiousness and the lack of effective antiviral treatment currently have become the focus of the national and international epidemic. Thalidomide has been available for more than sixty years, and has been widely used in clinical applications. It has been proved to be safe and effective in IPF, severe H1N1 influenza lung injury and paraquat poisoning lung injury, and the mechanism of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis is relatively clear. As the current research on COVID-19 at home and abroad mainly focuses on the exploration of antiviral efficacy, this study intends to find another way to start with host treatment in the case that antiviral is difficult to overcome in the short term, in order to control or relieve lung inflammation caused by the virus To improve lung function. This study is the first study at home and abroad to use immunomodulators to treat patients with COVID-19 infection.

47,Clinical Study of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Severe Pneumonia," The novel coronavirus pneumonia is a kind of new emerging respiratory infectious disease, characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest tightness, and caused by the infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In severe cases, there will be rapid respiratory system failure. The novel coronavirus pneumonia is extremely contagious and the disease progresses rapidly. It has become a urgent and serious public health event that threatens human life and health globally. Among them, severe pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus is characterized by extensive acute inflammation of the lungs and the patient is critically ill. At present, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.Most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. "," Since December 2019, Wuhan has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also found such cases. As of 24:00 on February 1, 2020, a total of 14,380 confirmed cases were reported in China, of which there were 2110 severe cases and 304 death cases. At present, there is no effective treatment for pneumonia in the clinic against new coronavirus infection, especially severe and critical cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more active and effective therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Human and animal studies have shown that after infection with coronavirus, the rapid replication of the virus in the body and the subsequent inflammatory response cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, causing diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema, and pulmonary function. Impaired, leading to acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The National Health and Medical Commission recently released the New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 5)"", which pointed out that the new type of coronavirus severe pneumonia usually has difficulty breathing after one week, and the severe cases quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, Septic shock and metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct. It can be seen that the key to the treatment of new coronavirus severe pneumonia is to inhibit the super-inflammatory immune response caused by the virus, thereby reducing the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, and then repairing the structure and function of lung tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most studied and important adult stem cells. A large amount of evidence shows that MSCs can migrate to and return to damaged tissues, exert strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, resist apoptosis and inhibit tissue fibrosis, and reduce tissue damage. Many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus-induced lung injury and mortality in mice. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs, UC-MSCs) have been widely used because of their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, fast self-renewal and strong proliferation ability Research on the treatment of various diseases. Early research in this laboratory used UC-MSCs to intervene in endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice, and confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect mouse lung tissue from endotoxin-induced damage. The purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This trial will recruit 48 patients. 24 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (4 times) of 5.0*10E6 cells/kg of UC-MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 24 patients received conventional treatment were used as control group. The respiratory function, pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days to 96 weeks follow up.

After the addition of thalidomide, the reported 35 patients did not Deaths. Subsequent basic research at Fudan University confirmed that thalidomide can treat H1N1 lung injury. And think that the combination with antiviral drugs may be a better alternative strategy for H1N1 before the vaccine is successfully developed. In view of the fact that there is currently no effective antiviral therapy, the prevention or treatment of lung injury caused by COVID-19 can be an alternative target for current treatment.

51,A Pilot Study of Bevacizumab in the Treatment of Severe or Critical Patients With COVID-19 Pneumonia (BEST-CP)," The novel identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 causes an nationwide outbreak as well as public health crisis in China, and expands globally. Pulmonary edema is one of the most detrimental symptoms and usually presents in severe and critical coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting in dyspnea, acute lung injury (ALI) ,acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Recent evidence revealed higher levels of blood Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. VEGF is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Numerous studies have revealed that VEGF was a key factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALI and ARDS. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF drug, approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy, is a promising drug for ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 through suppression of pulmonary edema. "," In December 2019, a new identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in Wuhan, causes public health crisis in China and spreads worldwide. On February 11,2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus COVID-19"". The Chinese Government takes stronger and harsher measures to control the progression of its outbreak. Meanwhile, five editions of ""Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia"" has been timely and continuously issued, which play extremely important roles in guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China. The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever, fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea. Noteworthy, a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe and critical type, among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common complications, resulting in a large number of pneumonia hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or even ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. The rise of VEGF levels may be caused by hypoxia, severe inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium itself. Numerous studies have confirmed a key role of VEGF as potential therapeutic target in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due do increase vascular permeability and induce pulmonary edema. Thus, Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF medication, may offer a unique approach to treat ALI/ARDS caused by COVID-19. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with long half-life. It has been approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy, with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics having been widely understood. Therefore, Bevacizumab is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI/ARDS as well as reduction of mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients through suppression of pulmonary edema.

52,A Pilot Clinical Study on Aerosol Inhalation of the Exosomes Derived From Allogenic Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Severe Patients With Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia," In December 2019, a novel coronavirus infectious disease characterized by acute respiratory impairment due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China. So far no specific antiviral therapy can be available for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care, even with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are strongly recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. This pilot clinical trial will be performed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in severe patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). "," Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a worldwide urgent public health event, especially in China. As of February 13, 2020, over 63,000 cases have been confirmed with over 10,200 severe cases in mainland of China. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment existing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes, with mortality of ~10%. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to patients with severe coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) characterized by an severe acute respiratory impairment. Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves. Although human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs. The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed therapeutic use. The purpose of this single-arm design, open label, combined interventional clinical trial, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).

Many other risk scores and assessment tools exist to quantify nutrition risk but none have been specifically designed for ICU patients. Indeed, they generally consider all critically ill patients to be at high nutritional risk. However, the recognition that not all ICU patients will respond the same to nutritional interventions was the critical concept behind the NUTRIC score.

The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical white"" lung"". According to the experience of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability. The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Based on the above, this project intends to make the following scientific assumptions: based on the homology of the pathogens of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia and the coronavirus infection of pneumonia in 2003, the similarities in the occurrence and development of the disease, that is, the pulmonary inflammatory storm occurs first, and thereafter The progress of fibrosis and the progressive decline of lung function and mortality are higher than those of ordinary pneumonia. We hope that by adding pirfenidone as a treatment program in addition to standard treatment, it will be a new and severe type of coronavirus infection. Patient clinical treatment provides an effective and practical method. """," This study is a multi-center, randomized, open, blank-controlled, multi-stage clinical study. As there are no effective treatments, the project team will evaluate possible treatments (including but not limited to Pirfenidone) based on actual conditions. Ketone, Pirfenidone, lopinavir / ritonavir, remdesivir, single / polyclonal antibodies against coronavirus), explore the most effective treatment options. The first phase will assess the efficacy and safety of approximately 147 (primarily estimated) hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with Wuhan new coronavirus infection in the pirfenidone-treated group compared to standard treatment. Patients with influenza within 14 days of onset of symptoms were screened and randomly assigned as soon as possible after screening (within 4 day).

64,Identification of a New Screening Strategy for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infection," Since Dec 2019, over 70000 novel coronavirus infection pneumonia (NCIP) patients were confirmed. 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) is a RNA virus, which spread mainly from person-to-person contact. Most of the symptoms are non-specific, including fever, fatigue, dry cough. Sever NCIP patients may have shortness of breath and dyspnea, and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The mortality is reported to be around 2.3%. Thus, early detection and early treatment is very important to the improvement of NCIP patients' prognosis. At present, NCIP RNA detection of pharyngeal swab specimen by RT-PCR is recommended. However, due to the universal susceptibility to 2019 nCoV in general population and limited number of NCIP RNA detection kits available, to identify an efficient screening strategy is urgently needed. This study aim to develop and validate the diagnostic accuracy and screening efficiency of a new NCIP screening strategy, which can benefit the disease prevention and control. "," This clinical trial is designed to compare the screen accuracy and efficiency of two screening strategies. Considering that the general population is susceptible to 2019 nCoV, a great number of people need to be screened for NCIP. The new screening strategy of minipool testing may not only obtain a comparable accuracy to the standard individual testing, but also save time and money, which may benefit the current clinical practice.

66,A Clinical Study to Investigate the Effect of T89 on Improving Oxygen Saturation and Clinical Symptoms in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)," This is an open-label, randomized, blank-controlled treatment clinical study. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, estimated total of 120-240 male and female patients who have been diagnosed with non-critical type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups, the T89 treatment group and the blank control group, to T89 or nothing on the base of a recommended standard treatment for up to 14 days . The primary efficacy parameters include the time to oxygen saturation recovery to normal level (≥97%), the proportion of patients with normal level of oxygen saturation after treatment, and the total duration of oxygen inhalation, oxygen flow change by time, oxygen concentration change by time during treatment. "," The breakout of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) begun in Wuhan of Hubei province in China in December 2019, and as a result of its rapid spreading nationwide, as of February 16, 2020, a large number of people up to 68,500 totally in China were diagnosed with a new type of disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1665 peoples were died due to this disease in China. Based on the recent epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of this new coronavirus is 1-14 days and 3-7 days for most people before they show any symptom, such as fever, fatigue and dry cough that are the main clinical symptoms a few patients will also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea and other symptoms. Severe patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after onset of the disease, and the rapid progression for these patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction. According to the Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment)"" recently issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the general treatment will include close monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation at finger, additionally, monitoring routine blood test, routine urine test, coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis based on individual condition, and providing effective oxygen inhalation treatment (including nasal catheter, mask oxygen supply and transnasal high flow oxygen therapy) in time. T89 have the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, regulating Qi and relieving pain. Four clinical trials conducted in China and abroad have shown that T89 can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of acute high altitude reaction, improve blood oxygen saturation, significantly increase the exercise time in treadmill and metabolic equivalents of task and enhance exercise tolerance under hypoxic environment. Modern pharmacological and gene network-based studies have shown that T89 can improve the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells, increase oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of major organs such as heart, brain, lung and kidney caused by hypoxia, and prevent the decrease of oxygen saturation by improving the energy metabolism disorder caused by hypoxia. At the same time, T89 can inhibit the reduction of hematocrit, albumin leakage, neutrophil CD18 and adhesion factor of endothelial cells (ICAM-1), by which T89 has a good therapeutic effect on microcirculation disorders caused by many diseases. In conclusion, T89 can improve the ability of carrying oxygen of red blood cells, increase the oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of heart, brain, lung and kidney and other major organs caused by hypoxia, and it can significantly improve the microcirculation disorder. At the same time, in the ""Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Atypical Pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes, SARS) P (2003 edition)"" has also recommended T89 can be used as a traditional Chinese patent medicine to treat patients of advanced stage and severe SARS lung asthma syndrome by its effect of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. In conclusion, T89 can improve the oxygen saturation and the clinical symptoms of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result, there may be some benefits for these patients to use T89 in current clinical treatment. This exploratory treatment clinical study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the study design characterized by open-label, randomized and blank-control.

"," To date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progress to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbility and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources. In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected eukaryotic cells.Based on the genetic similarities between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized. While further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of COVID-19 related disease, when administered at an early stage.

72,Nitric Oxide Gas Inhalation Therapy for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Due to COVID-19.," The investigators will enroll 102 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients will be randomized to receive either inhaled nitric oxide (per protocol) or placebo. ICU Standards of care will be the institution's own protocols (such as ventilation strategies and use and dose of antivirals and antimicrobials, steroids, inotropic and vasopressor agents). "," 2019-new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (COVID-19) is highly contagious and responsible for thousands of casualties. Originated in Wuhan (China), the 2019-nCoV is spreading to many countries, including Italy, Korea and Japan. While no targeted-treatment against 2019-nCoV virus is available to-date, inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown antiviral activity against Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The investigators designed this study to assess whether inhaled NO improves survival in patients affected with severe COVID-2019. The clinical spectrum of symptomatic patients ranges from mild upper respiratory syndrome to severe diffuse viral pneumonia in the context of severe multiorgan dysfunction leading to death. In China, overall reported fatality rate is between 2.2% in patients with proven infection. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, about 25% required admission to ICU. Of these, 61% of patients met clinical criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In another retrospective study in Wuhan (China) on 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the incidence of patients with pneumonia meeting ARDS criteria was 67%. ICU mortality reached 63%, with various profiles of combined organ failure in deceased patients (81% with ARDS, 37.5% with AKI, 28% with cardiac injury and 28% with liver failure). In 2004, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, it was demonstrated that treatment with NO reversed pulmonary hypertension, improved severe hypoxia and shortened the length of ventilatory support as compared to matched control patients with SARS-CoV. In a subsequent in-vitro study, NO donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of SARS-CoV-infected eukaryotic cells, suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. Coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV shares most of the genome of COVID-19 indicating potential effectiveness of inhaled NO therapy in these patients. Here, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial aimed to prevent progression of the disease in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Control group: the institutional standard of care will be delivered. Treatment group: in addition to standard therapy, the subjects will receive inhalation of NO. Inspired NO/N2 will be delivered at 80 parts per million (ppm) in the first 48 hours of enrollment. After that, NO levels will be decreased to 40 ppm until severe hypoxia resolves. Weaning from NO will start when patients improves the level of oxygenation to a PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg or SpO2 > 93% for more than 24 hours consecutively. Physician will follow their own institutional weaning protocols. In the absence of institutional protocols, NO will be reduced every 4 hours in step-wise fashion starting from 40 ppm to 20, 10, 5, 3, 2 and 1 ppm. If hypoxemia (SpO2 < 93%) or acute hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) occurs during weaning, NO should be increased to a prior higher concentration. Safety: prolonged treatment with inhaled NO can lead to increased methemoglobin levels. Blood levels of methemoglobin will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter or MetHb levels in blood. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the study, inhaled NO concentration will be halved. ",,,Withdrawn,Xijing Hospital
73,"Prospective, Randomized, Multi-center Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Mesenchymal Stem Cell(MSC) for the Treatment of Severe Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19)"," COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality. No specific anti-viral treatment exists. The mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Cellular therapy, using mesenchymal stem cells has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy for severe COVID-19. "," The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19. In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS.

74,Soliris to Stop Immune Mediated Death In Covid 19 Infected Patients. A Trial of Distal Complement Inhibition.," Covid-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world causing widespread panic, death, and injury. While this virus is the provocateur, it is often the patient's own disproportionate immune response which deals the most devastating (and often fatal) damage. A specific part of the immune system, known as the complement, has been shown to cause such damage in other types of coronaviruses. In the SOLID-C19 study, Soliris (Eculizumab) will be used to modulate the activity of the distal complement preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex. By modulating this portion of the immune response, mortality can be halted while the patient has time to recover from the virus with supportive medical care. "," Patients affected with Covid-19 will be offered informed written consent. An FDA emergency IND form will be sent. Once approved, the patient will then be vaccinated with both the seronegative and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Subsequently, antibiotic coverage against Nessieria Meningitis will be initiated and stopped no sooner than 2 weeks after the vaccinations were administered. The entire vaccination protocol should be completed. Soliris will be administered in the following manner: 900mg IV every 7 days for 4 weeks THEN 1200mg IV on the 5th week THEN 1200mg IV every 14 days ongoing until at least one month after the patient has recovered from the virus. Administration of Soliris as early as possible after diagnosis to prevent compliment mediated mortality & injury is ideal. Supportive care will continue during the administration of soliris Once recovered the patient's blood will be collected and sent for possible recovery of an antibody with the hopes that it may aid in the creation of a vaccine against Covid-19.

80,Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treatment for Pneumonia Patients Infected by 2019 Novel Coronavirus," The 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia outbroken in Wuhan, China, which spread quickly to 26 countries worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice. The present clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficacy of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for novel coronavirus pneumonia patients. "," Since late December 2019, human pneumonia cases infected by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were firstly identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus is contagious and of great epidemic, more and more cases have found in other areas of China and abroad. Up to February 24, a total of 77, 779 confirmed cases were reported in China. At present, there is no effective treatment for patients identified with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Therefore, it's urgent to explore more active therapeutic methods to cure the patients. Recently, some clinical researches about the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. It seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate. In our recent research, we confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly protect lung tissue from endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice. The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate safety and efficiency of UC-MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected by 2019-nCoV. The investigators planned to recruit 48 patients aged from 18 to 75 years old and had no severe underlying diseases. In the cell treatment group, 24 patients received 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously treatment 4 times every other day besides conventional treatment. In the control group, other 24 patients received conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. The lung CT, blood biochemical examination, lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory factors, 28-days mortality, etc will be evaluated within 24h and 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks after UC-MSCs treatment.

82,Clinical Application of Stem Cell Educator Therapy for the Treatment of Viral Inflammation Caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)," Currently, the growing epidemic of a new coronavirus infectious disease (Covid-19) is wreaking havoc worldwide, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China. Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect, immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery, and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with Stem Cell Educator therapy. "," This is a prospective, two-arm, partially masked, single center clinical study to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of SCE therapy for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients will be evaluated by the study principal investigator or co-investigators. Informed consent will be obtained at the initial screening visit.

86,Safety and Immunity Evaluation of A Covid-19 Coronavirus Artificial Antigen Presenting Cell Vaccine," In December 2019, viral pneumonia (Covid-19) caused by a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan, China. Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated. "," Background: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus. The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has warned that the pandemic spread of Covid-19 is imminent and would have disastrous outcomes. Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and the global economy. There is no vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the safety and immune reactivity of a genetically modified aAPC universal vaccine to treat and prevent Covid-19. Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection of Covid-19/aAPC vaccine to volunteers to evaluate the safety. Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 reactivity of the Covid-19/aAPC vaccine. Design: 1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, select conserved and critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral minigenes to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens. 2. The Covid-19/aAPC vaccine is prepared by applying lentivirus modification including immune modulatory genes and the viral minigenes, to the artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs). The Covid-19/aAPCs are then inactivated for proliferation and extensively safety tested. 3. The subjects receive a total of 5x10^ 6 cells each time by subcutaneous injection at 0, 14 and 28 days.

94,Nitric Oxide Gas Inhalation Therapy in Spontaneous Breathing Patients With Mild/Moderate COVID-19: a Randomized Clinical Trial," The scientific community is in search for novel therapies that can help to face the ongoing epidemics of novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) originated in China in December 2019. At present, there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. "," To date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources. In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when administered at an early stage.

96,Post-exposure Prophylaxis and Preemptive Therapy for SARS-Coronavirus-2: A Pragmatic Randomized Clinical Trial," Study Objective: 1. To test if post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine can prevent progression development of symptomatic COVID19 disease after known exposure to the SARS-CoV2 virus. 2. To test if preemptive therapy with hydroxychloroquine can prevent progression of persons with known symptomatic COVID19 disease, preventing hospitalization. "," Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing COVID19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is standard-of-care. Therapy to outpatients is generally not given. No effective therapy currently exists for treatment. The lack of effective therapy diminishes persons presenting post-exposure for self-quarantine. Having an effective post-exposure prophylaxis, even if only partially effective, may additionally create synergy for the public health strategy of case identification and isolation - if a safe prophylaxis is available. People who develop COVID-19 disease generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, after an average of 5-6 days after exposure (i.e. mean incubation period). The range of the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory-confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill with respiratory failure, shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID19 disease or early preemptive therapy may ameliorate disease severity. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide post-exposure prophylaxis / preemptive therapy.

Patients with COVID-19 induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome who are admitted for intensive care including endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation will be treated with Aviptadil, a synthetic version of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus maximal intensive care vs. placebo + maximal intensive care. Patients will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil will receive escalating doses from 50 -150 pmol/kg/hr over 12 hours. "," Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (COVID-19) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is associated with a 50% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure. Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event. Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority. Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI). In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion in addition to maximal intensive care vs. maximal intensive care alone. Primary endpoints will be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality. ",Rambam Health Care Campus,"Haifa, Israel",Not yet recruiting,"NeuroRx, Inc."

106,Nitric Oxide Gas Inhalation for Prevention of COVID-19 in Healthcare Providers, Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. This study will enroll 260 healthcare professionals dedicated to care for patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects will be randomized either in the observational (control) group or in the inhaled nitric oxide group. All personnel will observe measures on strict precaution in accordance with WHO and the CDC regulations. ," In their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2. Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts, dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected. The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e., negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles, protective garments and a gown and double gloving). Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5 meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation. Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 - 60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being improved. Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational group: a SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. A SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm. Blinding. The treatment is not masked.

115,Norwegian Coronavirus Disease 2019 Study: An Open Labeled Randomized Controlled Pragmatic Trial to Evaluate the Antiviral Effect of Chloroquine in Adult Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection," In the current proposal, the investigators aim to investigate the virological and clinical effects of chloroquine treatment in patients with established COVID-19 in need of hospital admission. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to standard of care or standard of care with the addition of therapy with chloroquine. "," Chloroquine is one of two therapeutics (in addition to remdesivir) that has demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and the drug is immediately available from national pharmacies. No delay is accordingly expected in treatment initiation after study commencement. In light of the evidence supporting chloroquine as a promising therapeutic in patients with COVID-19, the expected impact of the current proposal is considerable both in the short- and long-term. If successful, treatment with chloroquine has the potential to be the first evidence based treatment for COVID-19. The drug is affordable and the risk of side effects is low, making it an attractive therapeutic in large proportions of the population on a global scale. In the current proposal aims to investigate the virological and clinical effects of chloroquine treatment in patients with established SARS-CoV-2 in need of hospital admission. The investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine in patients with established COVID-19 is safe and will significantly improve prognosis and impact clinical outcomes. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine will increase the virological clearance rate of SARS-CoV-2, and lead to more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms, decreased proportion of patients with clinical deterioration and a decreased admission rate to intensive care units and in-hospital mortality. Considering the immediate and worldwide health emergency associated with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the current lack of evidence based medical interventions for this patient group, studies investigating such possible treatment modalities in COVID-19 are direly needed. The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the virological and clinical effect of chloroquine therapy in patients with established COVID-19. Pragmatic clinical trials are characterized by focus on informing decision-makers on optimal clinical medicine practice and an intent to streamline procedures and data collection in the trial. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), pragmatic clinical trials can include a larger number of patients at a short time duration and at a lower cost. Due to the immediate need for study commencement and the time frame of the current proposal, a pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomization and treatment. Data will be extracted from the data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital for eligible patient identification (i.e. electronic surveillance) and for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. The study will not be able to procure an acceptable placebo treatment and the study will accordingly not be placebo-controlled. All patients at Akershus University Hospital with suspicion of acute respiratory tract infections are examined with a nasopharyngeal swab, with subsequent microbiological examination, including SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR. Participants will be recruited from the entirety of the inpatients at the participating hospitals. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly, with maximum interval 24 hours, for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. The study aims to include patients by a sequential adaptive approach, where analyses are planned after the inclusion of 51 patients, with subsequent analyses after 101, 151 and 202 completed patients. All patients included in each sequence will be used for the final analyses of the entire study. This approach will enable frequent assessment of all outcome measures. Data will be collected from the hospital electronic record system, including electronic patient records, laboratory and medical imaging systems, and prescribing systems.

117,COVID-19: Healthcare Worker Bioresource: Immune Protection and Pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2," Modelling repurposed from pandemic influenza is currently informing all strategies for SARS-CoV-2 and the disease COVID-19. A customized disease specific understanding will be important to understand subsequent disease waves, vaccine development and therapeutics. For this reason, ISARIC (the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) was set up in advance. This focuses on hospitalised and convalescent serum samples to understand severe illness and associated immune response. However, many subjects are seroconverting with mild or even subclinical disease. Information is needed about subclinical infection, the significance of baseline immune status and the earliest immune changes that may occur in mild disease to compare with those of SARS-CoV-2. There is also a need to understand the vulnerability and response to COVID-19 of the NHS workforce of healthcare workers (HCWs). HCW present a cohort with likely higher exposure and seroconversion rates than the general population, but who can be followed up with potential for serial testing enabling an insight into early disease and markers of risk for disease severity. We have set up COVID-19: Healthcare worker Bioresource: Immune Protection and Pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2"". This urgent fieldwork aims to secure significant (n=400) sampling of healthcare workers (demographics, swabs, blood sampling) at baseline, and weekly whilst they are well and attending work, with acute sampling (if hospitalised, via ISARIC, if their admission hospital is part of the ISARIC network) and convalescent samples post illness. These will be used to address specific questions around the impact of baseline immune function, the earliest immune responses to infection, and the biology of those who get non-hospitalized disease for local research and as a national resource. The proposal links directly with other ongoing ISARIC and community COVID projects sampling in children and the older age population. Reasonable estimates suggest the usable window for baseline sampling of NHS HCW is closing fast (e.g. baseline sampling within 3 weeks). """," The proposed study is a prospective observational cohort design which will be carried out across three different trusts: Barts Health NHS Trust (St Bartholomew's Hospital, The Royal London Hospital, Whipps Cross Hospital and Newham Hospital), Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (Royal Free Hospital) and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH).

Arm A: CD24Fc/Best Available Treatment, Arm B: placebo/ Best Available Treatment. CD24Fc will be administered as single dose of 480 mg via IV infusion on Day 1. Total of 230 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive CD24Fc or placebo. Serum cytokine IL-6 level will be used as stratification factor in randomization. All subjects will be treated with the best available treatment. The follow up period is 15 days. "," As the newest global medical emergency, the COVID-19 (diagnosed SARS-CoV2 infection with lung involvement) exhibits features that are unlikely ameliorated by antivirals-based approaches alone. First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based approaches. CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19. First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc, but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 230 patients randomized into blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from severe to mild symptom as the primary endpoint.

129,Hydroxychloroquine Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for Household Contacts of COVID-19 Patients: A NYC Community-Based Randomized Clinical Trial, The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that post-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine will reduce the symptomatic secondary attack rate among household contacts of known or suspected COVID-19 patients. ," COVID-19 is a massive threat to public health worldwide. Current estimates suggest that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is both highly contagious (estimated reproductive rate, 2-3) and five to fifty-fold more lethal than seasonal influenza (estimated mortality rate, 0.5-5%). Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently needed. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19. Chloroquine, a related compound with a less favorable toxicity profile, has shown benefit in clinical studies conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In vitro, hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus chloroquine. Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments. Previously, hydroxychloquine has been safety used to prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune diseases. This study will test if hydroxychloroquine may be used to prevent the development of COVID-19 symptoms in persons who live with an individual who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. If hydroxychloroquine is shown to reduce the risk of developing symptoms of COVID-19 among people at high risk of infection, this could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 epidemic. This is a trial of hydroxychloroquine PEP among adult household contacts of COVID-19 patients in New York City (NYC). The trial will be initiated at NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP)/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC).

130,"COVID CT, Beaumont Quantitative Lung Function Imaging to Characterize Patients With SARS-COV 2"," The goal of this study is to evaluate if CT (Computerized Tomography) can effectively and accurately predict disease progression in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). You may be eligible if you have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, are an inpatient at Beaumont Hospital-Royal Oak and meet eligibility criteria. After consent and determination of eligibility, enrolled patients will have a CT scanning session. After the CT scan, patients are followed for 30 days by reviewing their medical records and by phone after discharge from hospital. "," Beaumont Quantitative CT lung function imaging (BQLFI) uses mathematical modeling to determine regional differences in ventilation (CT-V) and pulmonary blood mass (PBM) from a pair of inspiration-expiration CT scans or time-resolved four-dimensional (4D) CT scans. CT-V and PBM images provide surrogates for pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, respectively, in the form of detailed functional maps. CT-V and PBM therefore allow us to distinguish healthy from abnormal lung. Moreover, the technique generalizes to recover lung compliance imaging (LCI) when the CT is acquired at different pressure settings, in order to characterize lung stiffness. PBM and CT-V can detect parenchymal lung function changes at a voxel level and can be used to 1) assess disease progression in SARS-CoV-2, 2) detect treatment effects, and 3) identify early changes in high-risk patients prior to their development of disease. BQLFI affords the opportunity to provide imaging biomarkers that enable the early diagnosis of lung injury, which in turn cause impairment in gas exchange at the level of alveolar capillary interface. Currently, there are no available imaging biomarkers to predict patients at risk of progression or identify those at risk of developing severe disease with SARS-CoV-2. Our proposed study will validate a novel methodology, based on state-of-the-art CT-V and PBM imaging that can accurately measure regional ventilation and perfusion, as a means for improving surveillance, diagnosis, and prognostication of patients with SARS-CoV-2. This is a prospective, pilot study of 25 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2, who have mild to moderate disease, defined as positive PCR screen and not requiring invasive mechanical ventilator support or noninvasive ventilation or high flow nasal cannula. Participants will provide informed consent and eligibility will be confirmed. Demographics and medical history will be obtained. Participants will undergo one inspiration-expiration CT.

The Oslo University Hospital/University of Oslo web-based solution nettskjema"" will be used to collect data and consent forms. The impact of knowing the risk factors for COVID-19 is tremendous because it can enable governments to conduct more targeted public health measurements than today to reduce the spread of the virus. Detailed description Research into an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak is difficult because patients are isolated, and supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies are limited. The risk of transmission to study personal is non-negligible even when PPE is available. A study design based on an electronic questionnaire and consent from delivered from the Oslo University Hospital/University of Oslo, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant ""TSD"" service has therefore been chosen. The study will be a case-control study based on a combined electronic consent form and questionnaire that the participants will fill in using a smartphone and electronic identification.

132,"The Impact of Camostat Mesilate on COVID-19 Infection: An Investigator-initiated Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Phase IIa Trial"," SARS-CoV-2, one of a family of human coronaviruses, was initially identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city. This new coronavirus causes a disease presentation which has now been named COVID-19. The virus has subsequently spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11th March 2020. As of 18 March 2020, there are 198,193 number of confirmed cases with an estimated case-fatality of 3%. There is no approved therapy for COVID-19 and the current standard of care is supportive treatment. SARS-CoV-2 exploits the cell entry receptor protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE-2) to access and infect human cells. The interaction between ACE2 and the spike protein is not in the active site. This process requires the serine protease TMPRSS2. Camostat Mesilate is a potent serine protease inhibitor. Utilizing research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the closely related SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanism, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry can be blocked by camostat mesilate. In mice, camostat mesilate dosed at concentrations similar to the clinically achievable concentration in humans reduced mortality following SARS-CoV infection from 100% to 30-35%.

Around 20% of those infected have severe pneumonia and currently there is no specific or effective therapy to treat this disease. Therapeutic options using malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown promising results in vitro and in vivo test. But those efforts have not involved large, carefully-conducted controlled studies that would provide the global medical community the proof that these drugs work on a significant scale. In this way, the present study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the use of hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin compared to hydroxychloroquine monotherapy in patients hospitalized with pneumonia by SARS-CoV2 virus. "," The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is a new and recognized infectious disease of the respiratory tract that is now spreading to several countries in the world, including Brazil. Mortality rates after infection are higher in adults over 60 and with a history of comorbidities. The most serious patients need care in intensive care units (ICU). Most of the time they depend on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infection rates are higher than the capacity for intensive care, which represents a serious problem in medical care. Around 20% of those infected have severe pneumonia and so far it does not have a specific therapy, or even, an effective clinical management. Therapeutic options using malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown promising results in vitro and in vivo test. A recent, small, non-randomized study with hydroxychloroquine in 36 patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 proved to be promising in the ability to reset the viral load in 6 days after starting treatment. Thus, the present study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the use of hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin compared to hydroxychloroquine monotherapy in the clinical evolution by the ordinal scale of 7 points in adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia caused by infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus in Brazil.

In a few weeks, the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has dramatically increased, with almost 150'000 cases and more than 6'000 reported deaths on March, 16th 2020. Little is known on the rate of human-to-human transmission of this new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the community and within the hospital. Depending on the country, contact subjects considered to be at high or moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 are, either isolated at home for a period of time defined by the health authorities or, on the contrary, continue their professional activity on the condition that they adopt measures to prevent transmission to those around them. In most European countries, healthcare workers adopt this second option. In all cases, it is most often recommended that contact persons monitor their state of health and communicate it to the persons dedicated to this action. Whether such subjects become spreaders of the virus is not known, nor is the proportion of viral spreader who will develop a symptomatic infection. In this study, we aim to evaluate the virological and clinical outcomes of subjects following a contact at high/moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, in community-subjects and/or healthcare workers. The study population is represented by all subjects who had a contact with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and whose contact was considered to be at high/moderate risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition.

145,COLCHICINE TO COUNTERACT INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN COVID-19 PNEUMONIA," Cytokines and chemokines are thought to play an important role in immunity and immunopathology during virus infections [3]. Patients with severe COVID-19 have higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) compared to individuals with mild disease or healthy controls, similar to patients with SARS or MERS . The change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients are correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Importantly, previous studies showed that viroporin E, a component of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), forms Ca2C-permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation . The mechanisms are unclear. Colchicine, an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders (i.e., Familiar Mediterranean Fever and Bechet disease) and in gout, counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other interleukins, including IL-6, that are formed in response to danger signals. Recently, colchicine has been successfully used in two cases of life-threatening post-transplant capillary leak syndrome. These patients had required mechanically ventilation for weeks and hemodialysis, before receiving colchicine, which abruptly restored normal respiratory function and diuresis over 48 hrs [4].

To this aim, clinicians shared 20 cases of confirmed COVID-19 on an anonymized virtual database, for a total of about 44000 frames up to date. All team members discussed their clinical cases through online meetings. Images were reviewed by all team members, blinded to the clinical background, and listed in classes of severity of lung involvement based on LUS images. At the end of this process, a biomedical engineer expert in lung ultrasound collected the data and suggested a lung ultrasound grading system for COVID-19 pneumonia. Again, the biomedical engineer re-submitted the images grouped in different classes of severity to the study members, blinded of clinical data, to review again the images and evaluated agreement regarding the LUS scores. The score was defined only when all team members agreed. Methods In the setting of COVID-19, wireless probe and tablets represent the most appropriate ultrasound equipment. These devices can easily be wrapped in single use plastic covers reducing the risk of contamination and making easy the sterilization procedures. Such devices are much less expensive than usual ultrasound machines including the portable ones. In case of unavailability of these devices, portable machines dedicated to the exclusive use of COVID-19 patients can be used, although maximum care for sterilization is necessary. In these cases, probe and keyboard covers are anyway suggested, and sterilization procedures necessary following last recommendations. Sharing their real world experience in performing LUS in COVID-19 patients, the investigators propose two different ways of performing lung ultrasound with pocket devices aiming to reduce the exposition of health workers to cases. One operator uses the probe performing the ultrasound, the other one keeps the tablet and freezes images/videos. The second operator can be either in the room being at safe distance from the patient (about 2 meters), or even remain outside the door communicating by phone-call with the operator one in order to optimize the quality of images. Potentially, this last approach can reduce the operator-dependence of the ultrasound since the second operator blindly selects the images, being unaware of the clinical conditions of the patient. The two operators will follow an agreed, tested and standardized images acquisition protocol. Acquisition protocol Fourteen areas (three posterior, two lateral and two anterior) should be scanned per patient along the lines here indicated. Scans need to be intercostal, as to cover the widest surface possible with one scan. Standard sequence of evaluations is proposed using landmarks on chest anatomic lines. Echographic scans can be identified with a progressive numbering starting from right posterior basal regions. For patient able to maintain the sitting position: 1. Right basal on paravertebral line above the curtain sign 2. Right middle on paravertebral line at the inferior angle of shoulder blade 3. Right upper on paravertebral line at spine of shoulder blade 4. Left basal on paravertebral line above the curtain sign 5. Left middle on paravertebral line at the inferior angle of shoulder blade 6. Left upper on paravertebral line at spine of shoulder blade 7. Right basal on mid-axillary line below the internipple line 8. Right upper on mid axillary line above the internipple line 9. Left basal on mid-axillary line below the internipple line 10. Left upper on mid axillary line above the internipple line 11. Right basal on mid-clavicular line below the internipple line 12. Right upper on mid-clavicular line above the internipple line 13. Left basal on mid-clavicular line below the internipple line 14. Left upper on mid-clavicular line above the internipple line In case of performance of LUS in critical care settings (such as patients on invasive ventilation) and for patients that are not able to maintain sitting position, the posterior areas might be difficult to be evaluated. In these cases, the operator should try to have a partial view of the posterior basal areas, currently considered a hot-area"" for COVID-19, and however, start echographic assessment from landmark number 7. - Use Convex or Linear probes, according to the patient's body size - Use single focal point modality (no multifocusing), setting the focal point on the pleura line. Employing a single focal point, and setting it at the right location, has the benefit to optimize the beam shape for sensing the lung surface. At focus, the beam has the smallest width as is therefore set to best respond to the smallest details. - Keep the mechanical index (MI) low (start from 0.7 and reduce it further if allowed by the visual findings). High MIs, employed for a long observation time, may result in damaging the lung. - Avoid as much as possible saturation phenomena, control gain and diminish MI if needed (see example of lung ultrasound images in the figures). Saturation phenomena occurs, e.g., when the signal streght of the echo signals is too high for the receiving electronics to be converted into electrical signals conserving a linear relation with the pressure amplitude. This has the effect of distorting the signals, and produces images where the dynamics of the actual signal is lost. The visual appearance of this phenomenon is the presence of areas which are completely white. In this case it is therefore not possible to appreciate local variations in the response to insonifications. - Avoid the use of cosmetic filters and specific imaging modalities such as Harmonic Imaging, Contrast, Doppler, Compounding. - Achieve the highest frame rate possible (e.g. no persistence, no multifocusing) - Save the data in DICOM format. In case this is not possible, save the data directly as a video format. Visual findings, especially when related to very small alterations, do not appear on every frame. It is thus advantageous to acquire movies, where the lung surface below the landmark can be monitored for few seconds during breathing. Scoring procedures - Score 0: The pleura line is continuous, regular. Horizontal artifacts (A-line) are present. These artifacts are generally referred as A-lines. They are due to the high-reflectivity of the normally aerated lung surface, and characterize the visual representation of the multiple reflections happening between the ultrasound probe and the lung surface itself. - Score 1: The pleura line is indented. Below the indent, vertical areas of white are visible. These are due to local alterations in the acoustical properties of the lung, as for example the replacement of volumes previously occupied by air in favor of media which are acoustically much more similar to the intercostal tissue (water, blood, tissue). This phenomenon opens channels accessible to ultrasound, which can explain the appearance of the vertical artifacts. - Score 2: The pleura line is broken. Below the breaking point, small to large consolidated areas (darker areas) appear with associated areas of white below the consolidated area (white lung). The darkening of the consolidated areas signals the loss of aeration and the transition of these areas towards acoustic properties similar to soft tissue over the entire area represented by the consolidation itself. Beyond the consolidations, the appearance of areas of white lung signals the presence of areas not yet fully deaerated, where air inclusions are still present but embedded in tissue like material. This highly scattering environment can explain this peculiar pattern. - Score 3: The scanned area shows dense and largely extended white lung with or without larger consolidations. At the end of the procedure, the clinician will write for each area the highest score obtained (e.g quadrant 1, score 2, quadrant 10, score 1, and so on).

150,"Effectiveness of Interleukin-6 Receptor Inhibitors in the Management of Patients With Severe SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: An Open-Label, Multicenter Sequential and Cluster Randomized Trial"," Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The median time from onset of symptoms of COVID-19 to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported as short as 9 days. No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. According to data from the Danish Health Authority (www.sst.dk/corona), as of March 21st, 2020, there were 1326 patients infected with the disease in Denmark, more than 250 are admitted to a hospital, and >50 of them have required intensive care. Nearly 350.000 cases and 15.000 deaths have been reported globally. These numbers are likely to markedly increase during the coming weeks, challenging the capacity of health systems worldwide. In patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it has been described that disease severity and outcomes are related to the characteristics of the immune response. Interleukin (IL)-6 and other components of the inflammatory cascade contribute to host defense against infections. However, exaggerated synthesis of IL-6 can lead to an acute severe systemic inflammatory response known as 'cytokine storm'. In the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, a study found that a cytokine storm involving a considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines occurred, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Studies on the Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by another coronavirus (MERS-CoV), indicate that cytokine genes of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 can be markedly upregulated. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and TNF-α. These findings indicate that the magnitude and characteristics of the cytokine response is related to the severity and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. It has been suggested that IL-6 blockade may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for other types of cytokine storm, such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome including sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Remarkable beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade therapy using a IL-6 receptor inhibitor has been described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a retrospective case series from China. Currently, there are two available drugs based on human monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab (RoActemra, Roche) and sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi). IL-6 receptor inhibitors are currently licensed for several autoimmune disorders and are considered well tolerated and safe in general. The most common side effects reported are upper respiratory tract infections, headache, hypertension, and abnormal liver function tests. The most serious side effects are serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions. We hypothesize that IL-6 might play a key role in the cytokine storm associated with serious adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and that blockade of IL-6 would be suitable therapeutic target for these patients. We will investigate the effect of different types of IL-6 inhibition versus no adjuvant treatment compared to standard of care in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Primary objective: To compare the effect of either one of three IL-6 inhibitor administrations, relative to the standard of care, on time to independence from supplementary oxygen therapy, measured in days from baseline to day 28, in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

This disease has gain the attention of all nations after it has been stated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 12, 2020. Currently no treatment has been proved to be efficient in the treatment of infected patients by COVID-19. Natural honey has been demonstrated as potent antimicrobial in many research investigations and has been considered a good alternative for antiviral drugs for the treatment of some viral infections. The investigators aim to study the efficacy of natural honey in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in this randomized , multicenter, controlled trial, comparing honey in one arm to standard care in the other arm. "," The (SARS CoV-2) virus is spreading globally, threatening all healthcare systems. Many healthcare systems and organizations are using different protocols and measures to fight the COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and other antiviral medications are currently under research investigations. Natural honey has been well known for its high health properties in diabetes, nutrition, dyslipidemia, skin lesions and it got FDA approval for topical wound treatment in 2007 as the most potent antimicrobial agent. Honey has been previously considered as an alternative for acyclovir in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and it also demonstrated for its significant antiviral effect against varicella zoster virus (VZV). Many studies have demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial effect of honey as an antibacterial, anti fungal, antiviral and antimycobacterial. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Public Health England (PHE) guidelines recommended honey as a first line of treatment for acute cough caused by upper respiratory tract infection which is currently a cornerstone symptom in COVID-19 infectious disease.

155,"Efficacy and Safety of Chloroquine Diphosphate for the Treatment of Hospitalized Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Secondary to SARS-CoV2: a Phase IIb, Double-blind, Randomized Adaptive Clinical Trial"," In December 2019, the Municipal Health Committee of Wuhan, China, identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients. This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by that virus, COVID-19. Recent numbers show that 222,643 infections have been diagnosed with 9115 deaths, worldwide. This has been escalating fast. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. In this scenario, the situation of a global public health emergency and evidence about the potential positive effect of chloroquine (CQ) in most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, and recent data on small trials on SARS-CoV-2, the investigators intend to investigate the efficacy and the safety of CQ diphosphate in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the scenario of SARS-CoV2. Preliminary in vitro studies and uncontrolled trials with low number of patients of CQ repositioning in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging.

161,Cytokine Adsorption in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation," In December 2019 in the city of Wuhan in China, a series of patients with unclear pneumonia was noticed, some of whom have died of it. In virological analyses of samples from the patients' deep respiratory tract, a novel coronavirus was isolated (SARS-CoV-2). The disease spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan at the beginning of 2020 and soon beyond in China and, in the coming weeks, around the world. Initial studies described numerous severe courses, particularly those associated with increased patient age and previous cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases. A small number of the particularly severely ill patients required not only highly invasive ventilation therapy but also extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) to supply the patient's blood with sufficient oxygen. Even under maximum intensive care treatment, a very high mortality rate of approximately 80-100% was observed in this patient group. In addition, high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) could be detected in the blood of these severely ill patients, which in turn were associated with poor outcome. From experience in the therapy of severely ill patients with severe infections and respiratory failure, we know that treatment with a CytoSorb® adsorber can lead to a reduction of the circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and thus improve the course of the disease and the outcome of the patients. Our primary goal is to investigate the efficacy of treatment with a CytoSorb® adsorber in patients with severe COVID-19 disease requiring venous ECMO over 72 hours after initiation of ECMO. The primary endpoint is the reduction of plasma interleukin-6 levels 72 hours after initiation of ECMO support. As secondary endpoints we investigate 30-day survival, vasopressor and volume requirements, lactate in terms of lactate and platelet function. As safety variables, we further investigate the levels of the applied antibiotics (usually ampicillin and sulbactam). "," In December 2019, a series of unexplained cases of pneumonia in the city of Wuhan in China has come to light. In virological analyses of samples from the patients' deep respiratory tract, a novel coronavirus was isolated (first named 2019-nCoV, then SARS-CoV-2). The disease spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan in early 2020 and soon beyond. On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. In humans, an infection with the virus can cause respiratory infections and even very severe pneumonia, which often ends fatally, especially in old and previously ill patients. Due to the novelty of the virus, the data basis for therapy is very limited. To date, there are no clinical data for an effective specific therapy, nor is there a vaccination against the virus available, so that therapy, especially intensive care treatment for very severe cases, must concentrate only on supportive treatment of lung failure and other complications. The virus is very contagious and infection results in a relevant number of deaths. Due to very uncertain data on the spread of the virus in the population, it is difficult to estimate the mortality rate - case mortality is about 4% based on known case numbers. In reports on the treatment of the first cases in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) in January 2020, the need for intensive care treatment is described for about a quarter of the inpatient cases, 10-17% had to be ventilated invasively, and venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) was necessary in 2-4% of the inpatient cases. Patients requiring ECMO have an extremely high mortality rate of 83-100% in the studies described so far. In severe cases a pronounced release of vasoactive cytokines was repeatedly observed. Excessive release of these vasoactive mediators (cytokine storm"") can result in pronounced vasodilatation and membrane leakage, which can ultimately lead to severe vasoplegic shock that is difficult to control. Ruan et al. and Zhou et al. have identified high interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels as a potential predictor of a fatal outcome when compared between survivors and patients who died of COVID-19 disease. IL-6 is also an important factor in the pathophysiology of severe septic shock and excessive immune response in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) - for both indications has been shown, that the extracorporeal adsorption of IL-6 and other vasoactive substances in a CytoSorb® adsorber (CytoSorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) leads to a significant reduction of these cytokines in the patient blood. Clinical experience and (previously unpublished) data from our monocentric registry study show that cytokine adsorption in a CytoSorb® Adsorber can also be safely integrated into a vv-ECMO system. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption on humoral inflammation parameters and patient survival under controlled conditions in patients with severe COVID-19 disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

This study will provide rapid responses to caregivers and diabetic patients regarding the risk factors for COVID-19 infection, but also to assess the prognostic factors of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. Ultimately, this pilot study should also serve as a basis for the development of new studies in the field and the establishment of recommendations for the management of diabetic patients with COVID-19.

166,Single-Arm Observational Study Designed to Clinically Evaluate Cordio Application in Adult Patients Positive to COVID19," Study on adult patients positive to COVID19 virus. After signing informed consent and undergoing screening assessments, eligible patients will record few times a day several pre-defined sentences to the Cordio App installed in a smartphone/tablet. The app will upload the vocal data to the sponsor's servers for analysis. The patient will record at hospital admittance (COVID19 positive) until patient defined as COVID19 negative and free of relevant clinical symptoms. ",,,,Not yet recruiting,Cordio Medical
167,Prevalence and Incidence of COVID-19 Infection in Patients With Chronic Plaque Psoriasis on Immunosuppressant Therapy, This study will assess the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis on immunosuppressant therapy. ," The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has hit Northern Italy (including the Veneto region) particularly hard, causing several deaths and putting a huge strain on the Italian National Healthcare System. In the absence of specific treatments, preventing the infection from spreading remains the only effective measure. There is a lot of apprehension both from doctors (including dermatologists, rheumatologists and gastroenterologists) and their patients that immunosuppressive medications (biologics, methotrexate, ciclosporin and corticosteroids) might lead to an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection or negatively influence the course of the infection. However, there is currently a lack of scientific evidence to recommend whether immunosuppressive treatments should or should not be continued in patients who have no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Besides, treatment discontinuation would cause flare-ups of diseases - such as plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases - which are invalidating and have a relatively high prevalence in the Veneto population. In the Unit of Dermatology of the Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Intergrata di Verona alone, more than 2000 patients are currently being treated with immunosuppressive agents. As of now, there are no data available on the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with immune-mediated diseases, nor can data from randomized clinical trials be extrapolated to the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in patients on biologic drugs. This study aims to assess the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 infection in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis on immunosuppressive therapy and to identify associated risk factors. Such data would prove invaluable for clinicians dealing with patients on immunosuppressive agents during the coronavirus outbreak. ",,,Not yet recruiting,Universita di Verona
168,Cardiac complicAtions in Patients With SARS Corona vIrus 2 regisTrY, CAPACITY (www.capacity-covid.eu) is a registry of patients with COVID-19 across Europe and has been established to answer questions on the role of cardiovascular disease in this pandemic. It is an extension of the Case Record Form (CRF) that was released by the ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium) and WHO (World Health Organisation) in response to the emerging outbreak of COVID-19. ," The aim of CAPACITY is to collect data regarding the cardiovascular history, diagnostic information and occurrence of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients. By collecting this information in a standardized manner, CAPACITY can aid in providing more insight in (1) the incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19, and (2) the vulnerability and clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with an underlying cardiovascular disease. The CAPACITY extension to the ISARIC-WHO CRF consists of additional data collection instruments for: - cardiac history and cardiovascular risk factors - prior use of cardiac medication or NSAIDs - electrocardiography (ECG) - echocardiography - cardiac MRI - invasive cardiac procedures - cardiac complications - cardiac biomarkers - cardiac outcome during admission ",University Medical Center Utrecht,"Utrecht, Netherlands",Recruiting,UMC Utrecht
169,Sero-epidemiological Study of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in France: Constitution of a Collection of Human Biological Samples," On January 2020, the discovery of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was officially announced by the Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO). Its complete genome was sequenced by the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur on 29 January 2020 in France. This will allow the identification of antigenic structures involved in the immune response and the development of serological diagnostic tests. Many questions are being asked about this new virus and the infection it causes, including questions about the percentage of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic forms. Serological studies can provide answers to these questions. There is no serological test for SARS-COV-2 yet, but the laboratory of respiratory infection viruses at the Institut Pasteur is working on its development. We propose to carry out a collection of samples taken from subjects who travelled to China before the epidemic outbreak or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. As soon as it is available, serology will be performed on the collected samples.
